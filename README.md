# Dotfiles 
# By Andrew M. James 
---
This is a collection of all of my <whatever>rc files. Or really 
any file that has configuration/macros/shortcuts for some program I use. Ideally 
I can clone the repo on any computer and I will have most of the 
environment set up the way I like it, and if I am playing around with 
something and I break it I have long line of working predecessors to fall back 
on!
##cshrc
-using the tcshell on my mac. 

##basrc
-bashrc file for any computers I may come across

##vimrc
-vim settings/binding/functions that I find handy, as well as plugins 

##mutt
-various setup/config files for the mutt mail client.

##oflineimap
-used in conduction with mutt to get new email from gmail's IMAP servers 


##dotfileshelper
-python script that puts all of the stuff where it needs to be 
(If I make edits here I run the script to deploy them, or if 
I pull the repo to a new system then the script will deploy that.)
