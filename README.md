# Dotfiles

Essential Linux/Unix configuration files. I started most of this by shamlessly copying from someone, so feel free to shamelessly copy from me

##Credits:
- Vim stuff modified (very slightly) from [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)
- ARCH bashrc file has ssh-agent management code from [this stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18880024/start-ssh-agent-on-login)
- most of the magic behind my bashrc (prompt, ect) is using [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)


###TO DO:
[] bash setup script (in progress)
[] login script that pulls changes
[] logout script that pushes changes
[] overall setup script
