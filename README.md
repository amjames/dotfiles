Essential Linux/Unix configuration files. I started most of this by shamlessly copying from someone, so feel free to shamelessly copy from me
##cshrc
- using the tcshell on my mac. 

##basrc
- bashrc file for any computers I may come across

##vimrc
- vim settings/binding/functions that I find handy, as well as plugins 

##mutt
- various setup/config files for the mutt mail client.

##oflineimap
- used in conjunction with mutt to get new email from gmail's IMAP servers 

##mklink
- Script that will make a symbolic link(s) to set up the target environment
- f. and d. tags on files and directories just make life a little easier for the script and now all the .<whatever> files arent hidden 
- _Usage_
    mklink vim 
    - makes a symbolic link in ~/ to f.vimrc and calls it ~/.vimrc 
    - makes a symbolic link in ~/.vim to d.after and calls it ~/.vim/after
