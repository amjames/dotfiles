Mr. Marshall,

I do still have classes to take; actually our program milestones like =
the defense/prelim/etc are considered courses, so I have tuition to pay =
the whole time I am here. =20

I looked at the contract I signed for my GTA back in august and right =
now I have tuition paid, and a stipend of $11,200. I pay my student fees =
out of the stipend my GTA does not cover it. =20

Does that help? I sort of naively assumed that there was a standard =
GTA/GRA contract and only the duties changed from one department/role to =
another.=20
