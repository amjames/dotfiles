Hello darling,
Just thought I'd check in to see how my favorite theorist is doing today. I
actually had a rather productive day today - I've still got lots to do but
I feel bad leaving Carson alone for so much time this week. Should I have
her come pick me up? If you think you'll be at a logical stopping point
soonish then I'll just stick around and catch a ride with you, but
otherwise I'll have her come get me soon. You still want to go climbing
tonight?
=)
