Hi AJ,

I looked over your changes briefly, and they look good, though I want to =
compare the discussions and current code closely before crossing off the =
ticket. I see you=E2=80=99ve made a fork. If you want an excuse to =
practice using it and the pull request mechanism, you could fix up test =
case mints8=E2=80=93 two lines should do it.

Thanks for your contribution,
Lori
