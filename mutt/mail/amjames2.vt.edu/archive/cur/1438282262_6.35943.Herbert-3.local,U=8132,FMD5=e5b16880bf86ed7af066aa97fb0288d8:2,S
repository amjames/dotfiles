Andrew,


Thank you for your interest in the ARC GRA position.  This message is to
inform you that we have selected another candidate for the position.

We appreciate you taking the time to apply with our group and wish you the
best of luck in your future endeavors. You were one of our very top
candidates. There was some last minute number crunching to see if we could
get funding for more than 1 position, but we were unsuccessful there. I am
going to keep your resume on file in the event another position or funding
becomes available.

Best regards,

Brian Marshall

ARC
