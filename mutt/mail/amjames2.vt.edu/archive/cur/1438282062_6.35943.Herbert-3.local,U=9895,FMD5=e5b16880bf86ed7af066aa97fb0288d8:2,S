Thanks!

I'll try the code. Thank you very much for the example, I've done some 
Psi4 calculations before, but its much better having a template from you.

For the moment, I can live with the current version installed in my 
laptop, but sure I'd thank you can help getting it to the last version 
in the coming days. First, I would like to try playing a bit with the 
installations options myself (mainly --with-plugins), so that I can take 
max of it while being around some of the developers!
