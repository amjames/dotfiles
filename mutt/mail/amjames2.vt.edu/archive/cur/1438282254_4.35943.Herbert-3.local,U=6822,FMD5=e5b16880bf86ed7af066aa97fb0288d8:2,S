Hi Joli,=20

I have completed my plan of study, and I have signatures from all of my =
committee members (save Dr. Mayhall, but I have discussed with Dr. =
Morris that he could give approval via email).  I have two questions:=20

Should I get signatures from Dr. Morris, and Dr. Tanko or do I hand it =
in and then you can get it to them to sign?=20

Would you like me to attach Dr. Mayhall=E2=80=99s e-mail to the packet, =
just forward it to you, or to someone else?=20

Thanks
Andrew James=20
