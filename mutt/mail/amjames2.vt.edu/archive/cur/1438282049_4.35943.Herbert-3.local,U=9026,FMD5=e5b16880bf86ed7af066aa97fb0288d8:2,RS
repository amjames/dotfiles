Andrew,

Thank you, I have registered online.

I do have one question about travel, what time does the summer school end
on July 1? Right now I have two options for my return flight the first
leaves at 2:30 pm and the other 4:30 pm. Which would you suggest?

Also, which day do we check out of the dorms?

Thank you,

Tyler
