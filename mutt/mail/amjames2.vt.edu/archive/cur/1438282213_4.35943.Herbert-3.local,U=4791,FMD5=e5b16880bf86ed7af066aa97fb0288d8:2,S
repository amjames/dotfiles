To whom it may concern:=20

I think that there are two major failures of the current scholar system =
that need to be addressed;=20

For students:=20
1) Viewing uploaded documents in the resources section. =20
	you should be able to view work documents and excel spread =
sheets, and powerpoint slides. in the browser the same way you can with =
PDFs
	I for example don=E2=80=99t keep that software on my computer =
but my professors will use Microsoft documents in class materials. It =
would be awesome if those opened up in google docs instead of needing to =
be downloaded.

For Instructors/ GTA=E2=80=99s=20
2) uploading grades to scholar if very cumbersome to do one at a time =
through the interface that exists. It would be awesome if a GTA could =
download a blank grade books csv, then populate it with whatever =
software they use. Then upload the updated copy after they have entered =
their grades locally. I know that technically this can already be done =
but it is difficult to get the csv. file formatted correctly having the =
option to download a blank template would be super helpful and =
streamline the process!=20

I think this is awesome that you are asking for suggestions Hope mine =
are helpful.=20
