Pretty sure we decided against an opening reception, but TDC needs to confi=
rm that!
Oh I misunderstood - I forgot you had pickup duty for Sunday for the next s=
chool. I could always do it, AJ, if we decide to proceed with the bowling t=
hat night.  You should definitely be there.  And there's always Tuesday too=
.
Maybe we should all get together tomorrow and finalize what we can???

You've really done a superb job with this, AJ.  Should a career in chemistr=
y fall through - there's always event planning!

The Flyer:
I mentioned the idea to Dr. Crawford about making it and we haven't discuss=
ed it much since then. I don't think its absolutely critical, but if we get=
 something we like i would go over to Kinkos to get them printed.

Also for the flyer: Do we have a set time or place for the Sunday reception=
 (is that still happening). I have not gotten much in the way of details ab=
out that.

The Wed/ Sunday thing:
Yes, Sunday the 28th is when most of the Students for the Response Properti=
es School Will be arriving. Thankfully there is not as many of them, and on=
ly a few are flying. The one I have to get at 8:46 PM is the last one.  Tha=
t is why I think wed. would be a better idea, except a good number of the s=
tudents are leaving on Wednesday, so they wouldn't be able to go. We could =
get the smaller than 40 group rate though..

Bowling:
I love the idea! I think its a much better idea than just having like a din=
ner or something; people are free to mingle while they eat a bit and bowl. =
I don't know how it plays into the budget, but if it works I think we certa=
inly should!

Instructors:
ok, Phew.. I had a little panic attack that I had missed something major.

TDC hasn't committed to the bowling thing (although I think it sounds great=
