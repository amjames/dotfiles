Hi,=20
Very sorry to have bothered you, but I believe that I opened this ticked =
by mistake. I had submitted a help ticket dealing with my account on =
blue ridge, and spend some time composing it. I believe one of the times =
that I navigated back to the support page I accidentally opened a new =
account ticket. I am sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks,=20
