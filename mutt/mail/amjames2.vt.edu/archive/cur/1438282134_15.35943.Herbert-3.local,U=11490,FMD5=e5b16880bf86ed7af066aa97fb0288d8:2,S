Hey everyone,=20

We mentioned going on a hike tomorrow earlier in the week, but it looks =
like the weather is not going to agree with us.  We have moved the trip =
to sunday, so if you could please fill out this survey so we can plan =
accordingly.  We will meet at 11 am outside the dorms to leave for the =
cascades. We have two 11-passenger vans so if you can drive fill out how =
many can fit in your car so we can make sure everyone has a ride. We =
will most likely not need everyone with a car to drive.=20

If you are worried about being stuck in the dorms all day on Saturday, =
don=E2=80=99t be afraid! There is a beer festival at the alumni center =
on Saturday from 12-5pm if you would like to go details can be found =
here:=20

PS=20
I haven=E2=80=99t looked very far into the festival so I don=E2=80=99t =
know how much it costs, but that should be on the website. The alumni =
center is down perry street past the parking garage. I will put a marker =
on the map.=
