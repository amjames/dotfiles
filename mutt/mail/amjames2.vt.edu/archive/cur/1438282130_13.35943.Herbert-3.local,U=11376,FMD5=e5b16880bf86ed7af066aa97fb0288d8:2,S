Daniel ... any chance of getting a version of MPI compatible with the
Intel 15 compiler?   The present MPI seems to be set up for version
13.  This is not crucial (so is not worth burning any favors for), but
it would help in case people wanted to try mixing MPI+OpenMP and would
also avoid people having to switch (version 15 has much better
parallelization and vectorization)

Best wishes

Robert
