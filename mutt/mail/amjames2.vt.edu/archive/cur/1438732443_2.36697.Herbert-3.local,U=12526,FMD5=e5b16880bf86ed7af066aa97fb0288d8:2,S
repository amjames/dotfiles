Just to confirm, did you get the same (identical) NO occupations for the 
symmetry broken Cs symmetry as Anita did?

    Just to confirm, did you get the same (identical) NO occupations for
    the symmetry broken Cs symmetry as Anita did?<br>

        <div>I also agree that we have resolved the discrepancy between
          our UHF wave functions, and we're working now to obtain the
          CCSD NOs using the Cs symmetry-broken orbitals as a
          reference.  These NOs are obtained by diagonalization of the
          spin-orbital density (including its UHF component), and the
          occupations AJ has reported are the sum of the alpha and beta
          contributions.  I think this is consistent with your approach.</div>

              <br>
              I am back in Lubbock and followed Anita's and your
              comments. I think the agreement in the H.F. calculations
              is resolved. I expect that the NO occupations according to
              Pulay will also agree. The next question is how does the
              new UHF wavefunction affect the CCSD results. I imagine
              that one should compute a total density matrix from the
              CCSD wavefunction as well. Don't you think?<br>
              What kind of NO occupations and NOs did you use first?
              These were in the set of alpha and beta spin orbitals. The
              space parts are not orthogonal to each other. Thus, they
              are difficult to interpret. The advantage of diagonalizing
              the total spin density matrix is that the resulting NOs
              refer to the same basis. This question is more involved
              than I thought.<br>

                                                  mixings between all
                                                  orbital pairs where
                                                  the direct product is
                                                  Ag, so that includes
                                                  Au*Au, Bu*Bu, etc.

                                                  eigenvector will not
                                                  destroy the spatial
                                                  symmetry of the

                                                  will destroy only

                                                          would say that
