Hi Andrew,

Sorry to be a bother but I just found out that I need to sign a lease this w=
eek so I am trying to get it Fed Ex-ed to me up here. Would it be possible f=
or me to get mail sent to me somewhere on campus? It seems like it might be p=
ossible but I just didn't know whom to ask about it. Just let me know if you=
 think there's someone else I should talk to! Thanks!
