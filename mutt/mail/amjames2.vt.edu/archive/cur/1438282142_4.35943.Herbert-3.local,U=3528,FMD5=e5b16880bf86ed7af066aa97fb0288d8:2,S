Hello Natalie,=C2=A0




Yes! you are off to a great start. =C2=A0




In the last step however you need to be careful with the conversion of ppm =
to mg.=C2=A0




1ppm is 1 part per million. So that means 1 ppm Fe in your solution =
is=C2=A0

1part Fe/1,000,000 parts solution. =C2=A0If you want to determine the total=
 mass of iron in your solution=C2=A0you need to set up the appropriate =
conversion factor.=C2=A0

1ppm in mass is 1 mg/1 kg, and the absorbances you measured and the =
calibration curve you created correspond to values of ppm or mg/kg not just=
 mg. =C2=A0To determine the amount of iron in total cereal you need answer =
these questions along the way:=C2=A0




1) if the concentration of Fe in the sample you measured is x mg/kg what =
was the concentration of Fe in solution you diluted to make that =
sample=3F=C2=A0

2) if you know the concentration of iron in that solution how much iron was=
 in the original slurry of total cereal that you made=3F=C2=A0

3) If total cereal was the only source of iron in that slurry, how much =
iron was in it=3F

(not the concentration, just the raw number of mg of Fe)

4) Now if that amount of iron was in the slurry, and the only source of =
iron in the Slurry was total cereal, how much total cereal did you use to =
make it=3F=C2=A0

5) Once you have these values ( answer to 3 and answer to 4) you can figure=
 out the concentration in mg/kg of Fe in total cereal!=C2=A0




I hope this helps, if not try and mull it over for a while and send me =
another message in a few days. Glad to see you have started already though!=





My advice to you is to make a very strong effort to keep track of your =
units. When I was an undergrad I took a class where all we did was learn =
about how to work up this type of data ( even though we didn=E2=80=99t get =
to collect any of it) and it is near impossible to just power through the =
math and sort out your conversions at the end. You need to keep up with =
them as you go though.=C2=A0
