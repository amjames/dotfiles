Dear VT Student: 

The quality of teaching is important at Virginia Tech, which is why we strive to enhance your learning experience while recognizing good teaching and providing constructive suggestions for instructors.  We cannot accomplish this without your feedback. The Student Perceptions of Teaching (SPOT) survey takes only minutes to complete, but it provides instructors and department chairs with important information to improve teaching and course content.  

You can now complete the SPOT survey on your smart phone! 

Login here:  https://spot.tlos.vt.edu/portal

The survey closes Thursday, May 7, 2015 at midnight. 

Results will be shared with instructors after grades are submitted. Instructors will not be able identify which response belongs to which student.

Thanks for participating in this important Hokie to Hokie feedback.
