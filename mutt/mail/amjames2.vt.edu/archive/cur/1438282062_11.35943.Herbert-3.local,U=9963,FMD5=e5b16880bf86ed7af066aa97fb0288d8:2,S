Dear John,=20

Thanks. =20
I also have to apologize, but I was mistaken when I told you earlier =
that the school would end at lunch time on Wednesday July 1st.  We are =
hosting two school here this summer and the other program has only a =
morning session on the last day, not the software school. =20
Prof. Eugene DePrince will be speaking about GPU/accellerator =
architectures for the whole day on July 1st.  I am very sorry for this =
mixup.  We will of course still be able to provide transportation to the =
airport for your return flight. =20

Regards,=20
