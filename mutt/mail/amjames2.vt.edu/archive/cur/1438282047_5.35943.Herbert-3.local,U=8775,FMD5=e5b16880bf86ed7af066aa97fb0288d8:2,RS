Dear Andrew,

Thank you very much for your email! I am very happy to attend, and  
have submitted my registration at the provided link. I will be flying,  
and will send you the flight information when I make those arrangements.

Quick question: How late will the summer school go on July 1st? I see  
that meals are provided through lunch on that day, but I want to be  
sure to plan my flight late enough that I don't miss any of the  
course. Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

John Gomez
