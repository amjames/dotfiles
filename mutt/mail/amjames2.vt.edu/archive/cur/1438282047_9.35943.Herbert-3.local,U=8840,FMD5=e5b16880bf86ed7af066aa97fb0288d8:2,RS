Hi Andrew!

Thank you for the good news! For my arrival, I am now scheduled to fly to
Roanoke and will need to be picked up from the airport, but for my
departure, I will be making travel arrangements on my own (so no need to
drop me off at the airport).

My arrival is with U.S. Airways 4778 (the flight before the layover is U.
S. Airways 4536, but you probably don't need that). It is scheduled to
arrive in Roanoke on June 21 at 10:51 pm.

Thank you very much!
Patrick
