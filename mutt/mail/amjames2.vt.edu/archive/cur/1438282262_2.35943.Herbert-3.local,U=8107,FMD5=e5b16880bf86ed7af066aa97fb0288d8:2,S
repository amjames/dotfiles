Hello,

Sorry for the delay in response, but I have been working on exams this =
past week.  The software summer school applications are currently being =
reviewed by Dr. Crawford, and I believe he plans to give me a list of =
accepted students early next week.  Once I have that list I will send =
emails to those students who have been accepted indicating what steps =
they must take to verify they still wish to attend.  If you are not =
accepted then you will receive an email indicating that as well. =20

Thanks,
Andrew=20
