Hi, AJ,

I've made some progress on the natural orbital efforts and identified a few
unexpected pitfalls.  I'll keep you informed, but I also think we should
sit down together and go through aspects of the code so that you can
understand what I'm doing.  I've got a long list of things I have to
accomplish today, but perhaps tomorrow or Thursday afternoon might work.
