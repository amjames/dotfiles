Hello!=20

I am Andrew James, one of  Dr. Crawford=E2=80=99s graduate students at =
Virginia Tech, and the coordinator for the Response Properties School we =
are holding this summer.  You are receiving this email because your =
institution is located outside the US, and as of yet have not reached =
out to me about your visa application.  Part of this application will =
require a letter from Virginia Tech, and in order to make sure you get =
those letters on time I will need each of you to send me a copy of your =
CV as soon as you can.  Please reply with your CV attached, and if you =
could please rename the file like so:

First_last.pdf

If you do not require a visa (i.e. you are a US citizen working abroad) =
you can let me know as well and I will remove you from the list. You can =
feel free to email me with any other questions/concerns as well.  See =
you in June!
