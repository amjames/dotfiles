Prof. Watson,

Thank you for checking. Unfortunately I have to drop the class It is not
one of my required courses and I needed to drop one because my semester is
too busy and I am not getting any research done. I hope I will get the
opportunity to take it in the future. I dropped the class offically this
morning so the roster should show that soon.

Take care,


Andrew James
