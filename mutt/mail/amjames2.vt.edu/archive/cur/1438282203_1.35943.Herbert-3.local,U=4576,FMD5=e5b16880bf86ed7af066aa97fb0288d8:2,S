Good afternoon all - as we approach the round robin experiments (exp. 7 -12=
) it's important that you have a seating chart of your students in the labs=
.=A0 I know many of you may have already done this.The students will be com=
pleting three experiments starting with exp. 7, and the experiment they pre=
pare for depends on their lab bench. I have attached a very nice seating ch=
art that Tiff shared with me. Please use this chart to complete DURING THIS=
 week; you'll need to use this completed chart in the upcoming weeks. You c=
an walk around during this lab this week and complete on your computers if =
this is easiest. Thanks, Vicki Long

1045 TAs - next week is a virtual lab, so this coming week is the last time=
 you'll have the students until the round robin experiments begin! It is cr=
itical that you complete the chart during this week....
