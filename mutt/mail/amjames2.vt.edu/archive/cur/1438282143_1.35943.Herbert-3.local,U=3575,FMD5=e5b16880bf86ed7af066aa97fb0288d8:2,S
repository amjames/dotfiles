Subject:  Experiment 11

Dear Mrs. Long,
I was working on my write up for experiment 11 and realized I don't have my
value for the unknown sample recorded in my laboratory notebook. My lab
partner wasn't there last class so she won't have it either. I have also
emailed my TA over the weekend, but he hasn't responded and my lab is due
tomorrow morning at 8am. I have done all of the lab except the parts where =
I
discuss the results after I plug the unknown sample value into the line of
best fit equations that I created. I am not sure if I should write about th=
e
error, if I should use a number from a friend's lab, or if the value is
recorded somewhere in my TA's notes? If you could please let me know what I
should do as soon as possible that would be great!

Thanks!
