Dr. Crawford,

I would be fine with being the contact person. I would think this mostly =
involves answering questions from students? I have put you down for now, =
and if you want me to I can change it very quickly.

I will get the properties page setup right away, but I may need some =
help getting it online I don=E2=80=99t think I have ssh access to where =
theory.chem.vt.edu is hosted. I also am not sure what to use as a logo =
for the lefthand side of the navigation bar where the =E2=80=9CSICM^2=E2=80=
=9D logo is. I think that is the only thing I need to change other than =
the text.=20
