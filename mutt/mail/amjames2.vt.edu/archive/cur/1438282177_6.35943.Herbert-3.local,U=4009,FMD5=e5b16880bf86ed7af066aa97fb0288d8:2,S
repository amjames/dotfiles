OMNIGRAFFLE, OMNIOUTLINER, AND OMNIPLAN

If you'd like to use OmniOutliner or OmniGraffle with Omni Sync Server you'll find instructions for getting started in the in-app help, as well as on this page:

	<http://www.omnigroup.com/support/ios-document-apps-sync-server-omnipresence>

The in-app help for OmniPlan for iPad also includes instructions for setting up sync using Omni Sync Server, but they are written up separately here:

	<http://www.omnigroup.com/support/omniplan-sync-server>

OMNIFOCUS: MIGRATING FROM ANOTHER SYNC METHOD

If you are switching to the Omni Sync Server from another sync method, please follow the instructions on this page:

	<http://www.omnigroup.com/support/migrate_omnifocus_data>

OMNIFOCUS: FIRST TIME CONFIGURATION

If you're setting up sync for the first time, it's important to set up sync on the device you've already been using first, before you add any other devices to your account. Open this message in the Mail application (webmail interfaces like Gmail and Hotmail won't work) on that device and tap or click the link below:

	omnifocus:///setup-sync?url=https://sync.omnigroup.com/amjames2/OmniFocus.ofocus
	

If you don't have Mail configured on your device, you can also copy and paste the link into the Safari address bar.

You'll be prompted for your sync server password the first time you sync. Once you've got your first device syncing, you can move on to the other devices you'd like configure and repeat the process there.

OMNIFOCUS: MANUAL CONFIGURATION

If you prefer, you can manually configure OmniFocus:

We hope you enjoy Omni Sync Server; if you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns, let us know! Send an email to sync@omnigroup.com and we'll be happy to help.

Thanks again for using the server!
