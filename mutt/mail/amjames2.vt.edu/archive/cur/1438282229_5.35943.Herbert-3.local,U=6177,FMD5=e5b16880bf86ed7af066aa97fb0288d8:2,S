Hello Dr. Crawford,=20

The student from IIT Roorkee has asked me to get him a letter inviting =
him to the MRPSS.  He said that the confirmation email from conference =
services was not accepted by his funding agency and he has a very short =
window (until April 28th) to complete the application for funding.  He =
said that a letter on some type of official letterhead from you would do =
well, either emailed in pdf form or a scanned copy.  Is that something =
you would be able to provide for this student? He said it would just =
need to state that he has been accepted and invited to come to the =
summer school.  His email is :
chemvarun@gmail.com <mailto:chemvarun@gmail.com>

Also, would you like me to update the website to include the information =
you sent to me on Friday about international students acquiring visas, =
or just to give them the information if they contact me.  I am sorry it =
took me so long to get back to you about this, my parents came to town =
for an unexpected visit over the weekend, and I did not get very much =
work done.=20
