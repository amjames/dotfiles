Dear Dr. Crawford,

So far I have not collected NO occupation numbers, T1, D1, or D2 diagnostics for any of the molecules.  I am having trouble getting the ccsd jobs to run. They appear to just stop in the middle with no error messages after only a few minutes.  I have gotten ccsd energy calculations to run for phenylalenyl, but not the density calculations.  These calculations are in cerebro under

/cerebro/home/crawdad/ajay/projects/acene/sigma_freeze/phenylalenyl/ccsd/ 

I am currently trying to do the density calculations giving them a little more time, but I am afraid they will be in the que for quite some time now.  I have some calculations waiting to be picked up since 1/14/2015 still.

One thing I hadn't realized before is that most of these systems have open-shell ground states, which complicates our calculations somewhat in that we must use both ROHF-CC and UHF-CC methods.  We have one-electron densities for both of these methods, though I don't know if we've tested the natural orbital calculations for ROHF references yet.  I compute both D1 and D2 diagnostics for ROHF references, but there exists nothing more than T1 diagnostics for UHF references.
