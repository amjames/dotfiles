Hi Jessica,=20

Can the Students for the Properties summer school set up guest wireless acc=
ounts the same way as those for the SSS did?=20

I would assume they have to change the name of the program and the dates ac=
cordingly, but is there anything else that needs to change? (  I want to pu=
t that up on the website for the school)

Thanks,=20
