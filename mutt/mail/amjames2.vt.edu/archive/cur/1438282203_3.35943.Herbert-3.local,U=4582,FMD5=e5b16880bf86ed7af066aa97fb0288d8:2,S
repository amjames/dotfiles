WORKSHOP FOR SCIENTISTS AND ARTISTS: MODELING SCIENCE, MODELING IDEAS – register now!
Wednesday Mar 18, 10:00am-12:00pm, Moss Arts Center
With vast improvements in quality and complexity of data in the life sciences, what thinking skills do we need to make sense of what's there—and to make discoveries? Modeling brings precision and depth to the conceptualizations of biological processes, and embodied learning through "science choreography" catalyzes deconstruction and illumination of the core components and processes in modeling. This hands-on workshop, led by visiting choreographer and MacArthur "Genius Grant" Fellow Liz Lerman, is designed especially for mixed groups of artists (theatre and dance) and scientists. No experience necessary. Contact Sarah at sarahhf@vt.edu to sign up. In your message, please indicate if you identify as a scientist, an artist, or both. Limited space is available; slots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.

Anyone who can make this cold and all the snow go away will get a box of my favorite chocolate.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
