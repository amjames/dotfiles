Excellent, AJ!  Here are my specific responses:

(1) I'm working with conference services about the CV, letters, etc.  There
will be a link that we can add to the registration page for students to
send their materials.

(2) I like the agenda page as it is.  No need to change at this point.

(3) Love the map!

(4) Put me down as the contact for now, but we should talk about that a
bit.  I might ask you to be the key contact person, provided you're willing
to take on that role.

(5) Go ahead and get the property school pages started, using what you have
now as a template.  The instructors are (look them up to get their exact
affiliations right):

  Patrick Norman (Link=C3=B6ping U., Sweden)
  Trond Saue (U. Toulouse, France)
  Kenneth Ruud (Arctic University of Norway, Troms=C3=B8, Norway)
  me

The property school will have a fee and registration link.  That should be
coming soon.  I'll look into putting the site onto the theory.chem.vt.edu
site later tonight.

Thanks, AJ!

-TDC
