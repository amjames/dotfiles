Hi Nick,=20

This was brought to my attention earlier today, and it looks like I =
forgot to upload the grades for your section the last few weeks, or they =
somehow have been lost. Either way you should now have a grade for exp =
1-5, and 7,8,9.  I skipped six to start grading your lab reports.  I =
will upload 6, and the first two weeks of the last 3 experiment rotation =
when I have finished them. =20
