Hey Harley,

I was hoping you could clear something up for me.  Is there a way to group
together the different properties that we are interested in in the group? I
have
heard a few labels thrown around such as response properties or analytic
gradients, and I was hoping you could briefly explain what the differences
are there.  For example what would be the correct way to refer to optical
rotation, polarizabilities, and various types of spectra. Would I be wring
calling all of those "response properties" ?

Not an urgent issue. I am just working on this NSF proposal and I am
worried I am not really using the correct language.

Thanks,
Andrew James
