Thanks for the info.  Laurie has already taken care of the van =
reservations, and I also already made a request for parking passes (I  =
am still waiting for them to ask me to come pick them up though).  =
Whenever you can find out the building they are staying in and let me =
know that would be great. I also sent you an email yesterday about their =
wifi access?=20

Thanks,
