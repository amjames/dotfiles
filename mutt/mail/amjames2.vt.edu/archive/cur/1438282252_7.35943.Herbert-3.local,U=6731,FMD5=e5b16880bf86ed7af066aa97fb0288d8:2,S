Hello,=20

Could you tell me if this student Matthew Barclay is registered, and if =
he is has he paid? His PI just emailed me that he tried to pay  for him =
but it would not let him because the student was already registered. If =
the student did accidentally pay, can we issue a refund and let his boss =
pay the fee?=20

Thanks,
AJ=20=
