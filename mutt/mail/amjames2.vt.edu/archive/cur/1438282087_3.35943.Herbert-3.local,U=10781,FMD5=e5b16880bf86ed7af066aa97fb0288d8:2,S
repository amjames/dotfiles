Hi Dr. Crawford,=20

I have finished updating the SSS webpage. I have added information about =
check-in and arrivals under the students tab, as well as a neat map of =
campus. I also added the daily schedule breakdown, and some more =
specifics about social activities to the agenda page.  I added a =
resources tab, where I mention that students need their laptops, and to =
register for a guest wireless account (with instructions on how to do =
so). I included a link to the github, SWC=E2=80=99s setup instructions, =
and info about blue ridge and the module system under the Resources tab. =
The site is too big for me to just ship (even as a tarball), so I pushed =
it to this github repo. If you like the changes/are okay with everything =
I will send it up to the web server.=20

git@github.com:amjames/School_website.git

I was going to send a =E2=80=9Cpreparing for the school=E2=80=9D email =
to all of the students at the same time. I have a draft for you to look =
over below. It is brief since I have so much on the website.
Note: The email links to parts of the website that aren=E2=80=99t up =
yet, but they are in the git repo.

Hello,

The Software Summer School is only a few days away, and as you get ready =
to come to Blacksburg we want to share a few details with you. =20

Check-in and Wireless access:
Arrival and check-in information has been added to the school website =
under =E2=80=9CStudents=E2=80=9D.  There is also instructions for =
setting up a guest wireless account which should be completed ASAP. =
Please remember that the course will involve hands-on examples, so =
everyone will need a laptop, charger, and internet connection!

School Resources:
We have also added some materials for the School itself under =
=E2=80=9CResources=E2=80=9D =
(http://www.s2i2.org/school_2015/resources.html =
<http://www.s2i2.org/school_2015/resources.html>).  In particular =
Software Carpentry has prepared specific setup instructions that are =
available here (also linked on the website):
