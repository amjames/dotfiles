Joli Huynh, the graduate coordinator for our department let me know that =
I was going to be your Ambassador and I was chosen based on your =
interests in professors. That is all the info i got. To answer your =
question=E2=80=A6

I won=E2=80=99t lie I was a bit nervous when I first got my grad school =
applications back. I had really, really wanted to go to Ga. Tech. and =
work for David Sherill but I was not accepted.  I went to visit the =
Krylov group at USC and then came here to VT. When I left after my visit =
I had absolutely no reservations whatsoever.  I missed the regular =
recruitment weekend last year and did a mid-week visit by myself, so it =
was not the dinners, and things like that that helped me make up my =
mind. It was the flexibility and environment that Tech offers for =
someone interested in Theory.  Here at Tech I had the unique choice =
between two very well established professors, both doing method =
development in electronic structure theory.  When I had met both Dr. =
Valeev and Dr. Crawford, I left able to say to myself I would be very =
happy to work for either of them. The hard part was choosing which one! =
That is a very nice position to be in, for example if I had ended up at =
USC, and I did not like Prof. Krylov (I didn=E2=80=99t get the chance to =
actually meet her when I visited) then I would have been stuck. I had =
not other options at that school. I should mention we have also just =
hired a new theorist recently, Nicholas Mayhall out of the Head-Gordon =
group.

Tech also has some very impressive computing resources the department =
maintains its own cluster, Cerebro, and we also have access to =
school-wide computers. Most of my calculations are run on Blue-Ridge, =
the school=E2=80=99s  newest machine. Going beyond the hardware, the =
Advance Research in Computing department here offers computing classes =
geared specifically toward scientists.  I am taking a class right now on =
parallel computing applications, so we are learning how to optimize code =
for different platforms (very interesting and useful stuff).=20

The department is also a very nice group overall.  I came from a =
department with 7 professors and 5-6 students depending on the year, but =
the department at tech still feels like a small close group.  They go =
after every opportunity they can to bring everyone together.

Overall, I am very happy with my decision to come here.  This was =
definitely the place for me.  I hope I was able to answer your question!=20=


Please let me know If I can do anything else for you. =20
