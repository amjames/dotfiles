Dear Hans,

Yes, I agree that we should carefully compare our UHF wave functions.
Regarding the instability indices, the initial UHF determinant (which is
really RHF), we find the following negative MO Hessian indices:

Bu -0.103572       Ag -0.052371       Bu -0.016712       Ag -0.007614

We follow the Ag eigenvector and re-compute the SCF to obtain a new UHF
wave function with the following lowest MO Hessian indices:

Bu 0.032601        Ag 0.050644        Ag 0.097847        Bu 0.111535

For this wave function, the alpha/beta HOMOs have energies
-0.216068/-0.282375 E_h, and the alpha/beta LUMOs are at 0.092356/0.033109
E_h.

We don't have natural orbitals for the UHF wave function.  Actually, I have
to admit that I'm not sure what you mean by UHF natural orbitals since the
MOs all have integer occupations.  Do you define those as the eigenvectors
of the sum of the alpha and beta densities?

Best regards,

-Daniel

              Thank you very much for your e-mail. We are looking
              forward to your results. The most important question from
              my point of view is whether the restricted or the
              unrestricted approach is the appropriate one (see my
              previous e-mail). I think we should concentrate on that
              question first of all, taking the heptazethrene (str. 4)
              as example. According to your restricted calculations one
              gets a closed shell state, but our multireference
              calculations and also the UHF density shows the opposite.
              What do you think?<br>

                      <div>I want to apologize for the delay in our
                        response.=C2=A0 AJ and I have been dealing with a
                        pair of summer schools =E2=80=93 one focused on
                        computational chemistry software development,
                        the other on molecular response properties =E2=80=
=93
                        that started this past week and will continue
                        through next week.=C2=A0 I&#39;m the host and an
                        instructor in both schools, and AJ has been
                        invaluable as the primary organizer.=C2=A0
                        Unfortunately, the schools have pulled us both
                        away from dealing with the polyradical project.=C2=
=A0
                        AJ has continued his computations, but we
                        haven&#39;t been able to get together to go through
                        his results and provide you with a proper
                        response.=C2=A0 I promise that we will get back to

                            <br>
                            Thank you for your e-mail and the data.<br>
                            Concerning geometry differences: these are
                            very small and come from the fact that Anita
                            used Gaussian and Turbomole to verify the
                            consistency of the results. She sent you the
                            Gaussian optimized geometries but then
                            followed up with Turbomole calculations.
                            Finally, we decided to base all results on
                            Turbomole and she changed the coordinates in
                            the Supp. Mat. I am attaching her comments.
                            You can see there that differences are
                            negligible and you need not redo the
                            calculations.<br>
                            Concerning the question of the symmetry in
                            the UDFT geometry optimizations for
                            structures 4-8. These were performed for the
                            singlet ground states. The closed shell
                            high-symmetry DFT solution is unstable. The
                            spin unrestricted (U)DFT wavefunction is
                            symmetry broken and has only Cs symmetry.
                            You can see the orbitals=C2=A0 in Figs. 9S-13S =
of
                            the Supp. Mat. The C2h in Fig. 10S should
                            also read as Cs. Thus, the MOs have Cs
                            symmetry, but alpha and beta orbitals are
                            equivalent so that the structural symmetry
                            is higher, C2h and D2h, respectively. Thus,
                            the formulations should be correct. However,
                            we will explain this in the text. See also
                            Anita&#39;s comments attached.<br>
                            I am also attaching a paper on oligoacenes
                            where you see the same effect, the symmetry
                            broken orbitals (Figure 2) and the higher
                            symmetry of the geometry.<br>
                            <br>
                            Do you agree?<br>
                            <br>

                            symmetry breaking.<br>
