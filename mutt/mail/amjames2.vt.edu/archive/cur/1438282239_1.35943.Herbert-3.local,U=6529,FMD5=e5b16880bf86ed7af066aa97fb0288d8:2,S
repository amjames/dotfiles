Starting last Tuesday (3/24) e-mail users reported outgoing mail was being =
blocked and/or bounced back to the user.  The rejection notice was from "se=
nderbase.org".  It was determined VT's e-mail was being blocked from multip=
le universities and corporate systems.  It was understood the mail was bein=
g blocked due to the recent phishing and spam emails that some VT users hav=
e been tricked into clicking. The infected systems/accounts are subsequentl=
y used to send more spam or propagate more malware via email, at this point=
 VT end up on various block lists.

Please note the following:
An email with a malicious attachment has been received by several VT email =
addresses.  The email message may come from someone you know, however this =
email contains a malicious .ZIP attachment. Please do not open any unexpect=
ed attachments or attachments that you did not request.

For the latest status on this and other IT problems, please see the followi=
ng web notice and website.

Outgoing email from vt.edu being blocked.

IT Status
Update 3/31/2015, 5pm:
Our email reputation has improved with some of the major mail systems.  We =
are still having issues with a few providers and will continue to monitor t=
he situation.

Update 3/31/2015:
We are still experiencing issues with outgoing mail due to blacklist/poor r=
eputation.  Our mail team is working diligently to resolve the issue comple=
tely.  We appreciate your patience and apologize for any inconvenience.

Due to email/virus infection over the weekend, outgoing email from vt.edu i=
s being blacklisted and/or blocked due to poor reputation.  You may receive=
 bounceback email stating "554 Your access to this mail system has been rej=
ected due to the sending MTA's poor reputation," or something similar.  Our=
 mail team is actively working to get unlisted on the blacklists and off th=
e reputation filters.  Reputation recovery can take anywhere from a few hou=
rs to just over one week to improve, unfortunately speeding up the process =
is not really possible.  In the meantime, if there are recipients whom you =
cannot contact, we would recommend that you arrange to contact the recipien=
t via alternative means.  We apologize for any inconvenience.

If you receive a notice form "senderbase.org" notifying you of an e-mail pr=
oblem, please forward the notice to "abuse@vt.edu" or me (ljackson@vt.edu).
