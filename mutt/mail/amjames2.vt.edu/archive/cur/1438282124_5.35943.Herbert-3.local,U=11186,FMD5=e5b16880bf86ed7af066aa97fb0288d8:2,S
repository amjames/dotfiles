My inclination is to keep as many of these add-ons on as possible, consis=
tent with compiler availability, just so they get exercise being built an=
d tested. Needless to say, in practice I=E2=80=99m lazy, too, and have tu=
rned them off. As long as having add-ons =E2=80=9Con=E2=80=9D fails at co=
nfigure time, I=E2=80=99m good with it, but I agree that failing at link =
time is highly annoying.
