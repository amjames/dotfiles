Hi AJ,

Matthew did register, but did not pay.  The PI needs to call the registrar =
for this program in order to pay for him.  He needs to speak to Teresa McCo=
y at 54-231-8220.

Sorry for the inconvenience.  Our registration system does not let you go b=
ack in to pay online once the registration has been started. =20

Thanks!

Jessica

Hello,=20

Could you tell me if this student Matthew Barclay is registered, and if he =
is has he paid? His PI just emailed me that he tried to pay  for him but it=
 would not let him because the student was already registered. If the stude=
nt did accidentally pay, can we issue a refund and let his boss pay the fee=
?=20

Thanks,
AJ=20
