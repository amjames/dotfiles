You are receiving this note because you are a subscriber of the listserv
list glc-programs@listserv.vt.edu and the Google Group glc-programs-g@vt.edu.

As part of our migration of Listserv to Google Groups, forwarding has been
turned on for this list, so that email sent to glc-programs@listserv.vt.edu
will forwarded to the Google Group glc-programs-g@vt.edu. Forwarding for the
listserv list will continue until July 1, 2016, at which time Listserv
will be turned off.

Please change any references (including on websites, in emails, or in
printed brochures, etc.) from glc-programs@listserv.vt.edu to glc-programs-g@vt.edu.

If you encounter difficulties with this arrangement, please submit a
request for assistance via the web at 4help.vt.edu or, contact 4Help
