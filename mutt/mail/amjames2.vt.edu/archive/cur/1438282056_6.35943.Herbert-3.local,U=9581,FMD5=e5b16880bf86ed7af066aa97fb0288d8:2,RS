Christina,

I have changed the registration deadline in C2K for the Software Summer Sch=
ool.  Could I get you to change it on the registration page, as well?

It is:

Thanks!

Jessica

Hello Jessica,=20

It was brought to my attention that the Software Summer School Registration=
 is closed already.  We need the registration page to be open still as we a=
re sending acceptance letters to some last minute applicants . The applicat=
ion deadline was May 31 and it looks like the registration ended before tha=
t even on the 30th. Is there a way we can get that opened back up?=20

Thanks,=20
