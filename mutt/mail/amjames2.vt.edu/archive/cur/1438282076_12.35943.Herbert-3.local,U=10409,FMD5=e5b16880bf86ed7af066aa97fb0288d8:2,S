Dear Justin,

The Software Summer School is rapidly approaching (June 22-July 1).  We
have 42 students registered for the School, as well as six instructors
(four from outside VT), so I'd be grateful for 46 guest accounts on
blueridge.  When those are in place, I'll send the instructors information
on accessing blueridge so they can make sure they have the
compilers/libraries/etc. they need and can test their coding examples.

That reminds me: *can* the instructors actually access blueridge from off
campus to get things set up in advance?

Best regards,

-Daniel
