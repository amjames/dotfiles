 Dear Students (Faculty cc'd),


This is a reminder that it is time to submit your annual Progress
Portfolios.  These are due to Joli (jolih@vt.edu) by Monday, Jan 05.  She
will process them on Tuesday, Jan. 6.  If you cannot complete your
Portfolio by this time for some legitimate reason, then you need to contact
Joli promptly.


*Finding the Forms*.  In the "CHEM Grad Program" Scholar site, in the
Resources area, you will find a folder titled "Annual Evaluations."   You
are advised to read the "General Policies" section before beginning your
paperwork.  The "Student Progress Portfolio" document is the one that you
need to complete.  Unless you are a first-year student, you've done this
before, and you only need to update your information for Calendar Year
2014.

*If you are a first-year student*, then please accept the following
suggestions:

*On the Progress Portfolio Cover Sheet:*
(1) Wait until you get your grades on Hokie Spa (should be available this
week) before entering your GPA.
(2) List your new Advisor -- if you have not been assigned to a group yet,
then enter "John Morris".
(3) The only "requirement" that you have completed (check-boxes on the
first page) is CHEM 5004, which all of you have passed.
(4) You have not had a committee meeting yet -- the first such meeting that
you'll document is typically the Prelim Exam (targeted for Spring 2016).

 *On the Self-Evaluation Page:*
(1) While you are evaluating yourself, my suggestion is to enter
"Excellent" for Academic Performance if you completed three courses with an
overall GPA of 3.5 or higher.
(2) Research Progress is probably N/A unless you've been quite busy in the
lab.
(3) Professional Activities and Interactions is probably N/A as well.
(4) For anticipated progress, you could include things like bringing up
your grades (if you need to), completing some significant portion of your
project, completion of the literature review, finishing your course work
(if you can do so by December), etc.

 *For your Student Activities Report page:*
(1) For the courses you "completed," you do not need to include courses
that you dropped (before Oct 04) or from which you withdrew (WG).
(2) It's okay if the "key accomplishments" section is blank.  You will have
many things to put in there next year, if you are making adequate progress.
*For your Research Update page*:
(1) It would be appropriate to give a brief description (perhaps a
paragraph, with a diagram or scheme) showing what you *intend* to work on
during the upcoming year.  And of course, if you have made some results
(beyond just a couple of reactions that you ran), then please document that.



 Best,
John
