Hi, Andy,

I need to ask your input on the best place to include the computation of
UHF NOs within the UHF class.  I added them to the finalize() function with
no problems, and the code works cleanly, but I'm wondering if I should try
to be more elegant about this and insert them into the OEProp class.  The
problem with OEProp is that the approach we have to use to compute the NOs
really applies only to the UHF wave function, so perhaps I should keep the
code limited to the UHF class only.  Now, some of what this calculation
requires is already computed in the compute_wiberg_lowdin_indices() code,
namely the formation of S^(1/2) D S^(1/2), but this is so trivial that I
guess it doesn't matter if I repeat it.  The only thing the
compute_no_occupations() code offers is the nasty sorting and printing of
the NOONs.

Opinions?
