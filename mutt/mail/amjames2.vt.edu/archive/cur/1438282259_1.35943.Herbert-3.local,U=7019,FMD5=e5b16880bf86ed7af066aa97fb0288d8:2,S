Hello!

I am Andrew James, one of  Dr. Crawford=92s graduate students at Virginia T=
ech, and the coordinator for the Response Properties School we are holding =
this summer.  You are receiving this email because your institution is loca=
ted outside the US, and as of yet have not reached out to me about your vis=
a application.  Part of this application will require a letter from Virgini=
a Tech, and in order to make sure you get those letters on time I will need=
 each of you to send me a copy of your CV as soon as you can.  Please reply=
 with your CV attached, and if you could please rename the file like so:

First_last.pdf

If you do not require a visa (i.e. you are a US citizen working abroad) you=
 can let me know as well and I will remove you from the list. You can feel =
free to email me with any other questions/concerns as well.  See you in Jun=
e!

Regards,
