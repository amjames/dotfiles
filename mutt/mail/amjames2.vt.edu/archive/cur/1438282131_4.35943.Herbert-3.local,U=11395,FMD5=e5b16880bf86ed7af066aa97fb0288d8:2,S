Hi Jessica,=20

Can the Students for the Properties summer school set up guest wireless =
accounts the same way as those for the SSS did?=20

I would assume they have to change the name of the program and the dates =
accordingly, but is there anything else that needs to change? (  I want =
to put that up on the website for the school)

Thanks,=20
