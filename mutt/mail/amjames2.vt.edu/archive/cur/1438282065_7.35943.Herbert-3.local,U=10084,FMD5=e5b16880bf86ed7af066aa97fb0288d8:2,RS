Yeah... I think one van actually might be OK for pickup too. Crap... I see =
some late arrival times on the 21st!
I know there's still many to weigh in, but a smaller van might be fine - AN=
D provide the Smartways schedule for anybody who doesn't want to wait aroun=
d for others to arrive on slightly later flights. Obviously, we don't want =
to be waiting hours just to limit the number of trips.
Thanks for the schedule!

Laurie,

I have attached the spreadsheet I have with the responses so far.  It looks=
 like the flights are very spread out and another van might not be necessar=
y, but I don't know how long before a flight is acceptable to drop someone =
off.  The smart-way bus might not be a bad idea for the few students leavin=
g on July 1st so that no-one has to miss the last day of lectures to drop f=
olks off. We could take a look at the schedule and how it matches up with t=
he flights?
