This is Jonathon Vandezande, a future SICM summer school student. I
recently broke my hand, and will need major surgery on it. Thus I will have
to forgo the SICM summer school.

However, we have a 1st year graduate student, Avery Wiens, who would gladly
take my place. Avery is interested in the theory and coding side of
theoretical chemistry, and has a reasonable knowledge of Python. I believe
she would be a great candidate for summer school. Would it be possible for
her to take my place? If so, what will she need to do?

-Jonathon Vandezande
