AJ,

The MO-density is already diagonal for separate alpha and beta orbitals,
with occupation numbers of only 1s or 0s.

You can't diagonalize just D because the AO basis is not orthogonal.  The
S^(1/2) matrices serve to orthogonalize the basis, which allows you to
simply call a diagonalization routine.  (Go back and compare this to what
you did in your own SCF code.  You had to orthogonalize the AO basis using
a similar S^(-1/2) matrix before you could diagonalize the Fock matrix.)
