Dear Andrew James,

I am running for ACS President-Elect in the election this October because=
 there are some alarming employment trends affecting our chemist colleagu=
es, especially early career chemists, and the ACS must understand and add=
ress these.

We are all familiar with the issues that many of our fellow members face =
including employment difficulties, underemployment, diminishing opportuni=
ties for research, and the challenges of finding support for our students=
 and colleagues.  In short, it is an increasingly difficult time to launc=
h and maintain a career in chemistry.  As a membership society, we must u=
nderstand what our members are facing and what employers are looking for,=
 and we need an open and honest conversation within our membership as to =
how the ACS can address this.

I have three decades of experience working within the ACS to lead the Soc=
iety in new directions and with new emphasis, at all levels from local se=
ctions to international groups.  Change is possible, and I have experienc=
ed it firsthand.  I welcome the opportunity to lead this effort to addres=
s the issues I=E2=80=99ve noted above.

If you will be at the Fall National Meeting in Boston, I would welcome yo=
ur input at the =E2=80=9CMeet the Candidates for ACS President-Elect=E2=80=
=9D event on Monday, August 17, from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m., in Halls A & B1 i=
n the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center, North Lobby.  I always welco=
me your thoughts and ideas by email as well.

With Warm Regards,

Bryan Balazs, Candidate for 2016 ACS President-Elect
