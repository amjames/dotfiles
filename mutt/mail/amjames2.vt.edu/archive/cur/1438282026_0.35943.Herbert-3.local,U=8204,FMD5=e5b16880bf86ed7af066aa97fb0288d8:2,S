If the student had a 56 it appears they at least attended lab. So that is
okay. The student that has six 50=B9s receives an F. Thanks for checking,
Vicki

I misunderstood the first email, thanks I have got it now.

I have one more question though.  One student in this section has 4 50=B9s an=
d
a 56 he handed in a pre-lab for the ideal gas law, or part of one rather an=
d
then missed a few weeks and never handed in the post lab for that lab.  Doe=
s
that 56 save him or does it count as a 50? There is another student who has
6 50=B9s so she will be changed to an F, but I want to make sure I do the
right thing here for this other student.

Thanks,=20
