*Supercomputing for Everyone Series *
*Performance Tuning Summer School*
*8/17- 08/21 11:00am-5:00pm*

Supercomputers are more complicated to program and handle than an ordinary
desktop workstation. This may lead to parallel programs that do not
necessarily satisfy the performance expectations of the users. Such
unexpected performance results can have many reasons. Basic knowledge on
performance modeling, prediction and verification, as taught in this summer
school, is needed by users to formulate and verify their performance
expectation.  This course will utilize lectures and hands-on experiences.
The instructor=E2=80=99s goal is to have a 50/50 ratio of each.

*Please sign-up

20/session/710/register
<https://www.xsede.org/web/xup/course-calendar/-/training-user/class/420/se=
ssion/710/register>*
*Classroom: TBD*
*Questions: aromanel@vt.edu <aromanel@vt.edu>*

*Agenda:*

Monday: Performance Engineering (theory + examples)
Tuesday: Easy to use performance analysis workflows (profile or sample
based tools like gprof, time, collectl, and others will be used to quickly
get a picture of one=E2=80=99s program)
Wednesday: Usage of advanced tools (profile- and trace-based)
Thursday: Tuning of hybrid programs (message passing, threading,
accelerators)
Friday: Theoretical considerations (Experimental design, performance
modeling)

This course is taught by staff of UITS Research Technologies and Visiting
Scholar, Holger Brunst of the Technische Universit=C3=A4t Dresden is the gu=
est
instructor. Blue Waters will be the platform which will be used.

*What You'll learn:*

The background for performance considerations
A common performance vocabulary
Standard performance situations/parameters to be aware
The tools that provide insight
How to establish a higher throughput of experiments
How to run bigger experiments
Profiling and tracing tools like gprof, Cray Pat, Vampir, Score-P, and
Allinea MAP as well as simple visual and modeling tools like gnuplot

*What you need to know:*

Basic programming and command line skills on Linux systems. Knowledge on
how to run jobs on supercomputers.
Experience running scientific applications on supercomputers
