To: Chem 1046 TA Group; Dalton, Michelle (mdalton1); Long, Victoria (vilong)<p/>From: Victoria Long<p/><b>1046 TAs - please go ahead and upload the grades into HokieSpa with a few exceptions provided below (assuming your grades are complete):</b><br/>
<br/>
If you have one of these CRNs please go in and manually change a grade to an F for a student who missed 5 or more labs - you DO HAVE a student who missed at least 5 labs)<br/>

<br/>
Also, all students should get a grade. There are no INCs this semester, and I believe there are 2 students who can get a NG - these students NEVER ATTENDED any lab.<br/>
<br/>
The directions on how to do this are in the GTA handbook. Most of you did this last semester so assume you&#39;re comfortable doing this. If you have any questions please email me. Thanks much for a great semester!<br/>
