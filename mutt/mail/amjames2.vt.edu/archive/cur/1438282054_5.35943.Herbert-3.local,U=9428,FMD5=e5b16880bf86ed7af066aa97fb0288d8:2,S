Dear Andrew,

Thank you so much for contacting me with such good news!

I registered for the summer school in the vt.edu last week. I am planning
to drive to Blacksburg and I try to get there at 21 June before 6 pm for
check-in.

Please let me know if you need more info about my travel.

Best,
Mojtaba
