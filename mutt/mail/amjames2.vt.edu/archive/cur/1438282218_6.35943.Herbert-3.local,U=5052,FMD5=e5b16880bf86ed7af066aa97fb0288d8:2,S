Hi, all,

I believe we have finalized the websites for the two Summer Schools, and I
am preparing an email announcement that will reach the vast majority of the
theoretical chemistry community in the U.S. and Canada.  Below is a draft
of the text of the announcement, and I would be grateful if you could look
at it carefully and send me any corrections or adjustments as soon as
possible.

Best regards,

-Daniel

Subject:  2015 Summer Schools in Software Development and Molecular
Response Properties

Dear Fellow Theoretical Chemists:

I am pleased to announce two Summer Schools to be held here at Virginia
Tech this year that may be of interest to you or your colleagues.

*Third Annual Software Summer School, June 22-July 1:
<http://s2i2.org/school_2015/index.html>*  This NSF-sponsored Summer School
targets first- and second-year graduate students whose Ph.D. research
requires significant programming skills.  The School, which is part of the
sustainable software initiative led by the SICM2 Project, will cover a
range of software design and optimization, including programming
fundamentals, numerical libraries, parallel computing, and GPU/accelerator
algorithms.

http://s2i2.org/school_2015/

Interested students should submit an application consisting of a CV, letter
of support, and a brief description of their research and how it would
benefit from the advanced programming skills offered by the School.
Students accepted to the program will need only provide their own
transportation to the Virginia Tech campus; *all other expenses, including
room, board, and instructional costs will be covered by the School*.  (Note
that only student at U.S. institutions are eligible for participation in
this year's Software Summer School.)

----------------------

*Molecular Response Properties Summer School, June 29-July 3:
<http://www.theory.chem.vt.edu/response/index.html>*  Much of our
understanding of molecules and materials is derived from their responses to
electromagnetic fields =E2=80=93 from high-resolution spectroscopic analyse=
s for
the identification of molecules in interstellar space, to magnetic
resonance imaging used in medical diagnostics, to non-linear fiber optics
employed in telecommunications. This school will focus on the quantum
mechanical theories underlying both weak- and strong-field responses, in
absorption, emission, and scattering, at a level appropriate for graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers.

http://www.theory.chem.vt.edu/response/

The School will be taught by Profs. Patrick Norman (Link=C3=B6ping U., Swed=
en),
Trond Saue (U. Toulouse), Kenneth Ruud (Arctic University of Norway), and
Daniel Crawford (Virginia Tech).   Interested participants may register at
the above website (no application process is otherwise required).  *The
$550 registration fee includes room, board, and instructional expenses, but
not transportation costs.*

Best regards,
--
