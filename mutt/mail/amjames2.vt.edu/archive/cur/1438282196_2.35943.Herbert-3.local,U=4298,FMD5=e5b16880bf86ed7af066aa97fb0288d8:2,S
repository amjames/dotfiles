Subject: Completing Exp. 2 and Preparing for Exp. 3


Group: Site


Message: 



	Good afternoon all - just a few quick comments to get ready for next week. I will not send checklists out anymore, as by now you all know how the labs work. So, read page 23 for the laboratory requirements for exp. 3.

	
		Complete the postlab worksheet for exp. 2 (p. 15 - 18). Remember everything is printed other than calculations in pen (and stapled before lab). Also, refer to the original journal article (19-22) for assistance with the postlab questions.
	
		Complete the prelab questions for exp. 3 (p. 29 - 30) (stapled before lab).
	
		Prepare your student laboratory notebook in the back of your manual. Review p. xxi for the notebook requirements; there is NO LONGER an appendix to copy, you should now know what to do by the third exp. Be sure you have everything required, including the tables prepared to record the experimental data.

If you forget your goggles, please know that you can now purchase goggles , if needed, in the NNH 205 stockroom. So no students should miss lab for no goggles! Please remember you can always print at Newman library 24/7. Also, remember to review the powerpoint slides in scholar for exp. 3 and also the original journal article on which the experiment is based on p. 33- 36. And finally, be sure to use and or review the online chat posts for the lab in scholar; there's been quite a bit of great dialogue.

Thanks, and have a great weekend. Victoria Long
