Dear Mr. James,

I applied the third annual Software-Development Summer School one month ago. I haven't had any news from this program since I submitted my application. Could you please let me know if I get the opportunity to participate in this program? I would appreciate if I know the results as soon as possible, so I can have early plan for this summer. Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Yi-Jung Tu
