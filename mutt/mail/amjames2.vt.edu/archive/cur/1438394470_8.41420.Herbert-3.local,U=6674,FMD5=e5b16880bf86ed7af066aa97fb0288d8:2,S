              <br>
              It is good to hear about your progress.<br>
              Our procedure concerning the active orbitals for the
              CASSCF is a pragmatic one. First of all, the CASSCF
              calculation does not stand alone, it is only meant to
              provide appropriate orbitals for the subsequent MRCI and
              MR-AQCC calculations. The CAS space increases
              exponentially and very soon gets out of hand. At the MRCI
              and MR-AQCC all orbitals not frozen are correlated, with
              the AQCC calculation even higher (quadruple) excitations
              included explicitly. Thus, our focus is more on the
              construction of the reference space for MR-AQCC than
              having an extensive CASSCF space. For the choice of the
              reference space NO occupations of test AQCC calculations
              and the analysis of the major contributions to the
              wavefunction were used.=C2=A0 We have a occupation threshold =
of
              ~0.05-0.1 e. Orbitals for which the NO occupation
              deviates=C2=A0 from 2 and 0, respectively,=C2=A0 more than th=
at are
              included into the active space. Anita also looked at DFT
              orbital energies, to my knowledge.=C2=A0 She can give more
              information when needed. Another point was that the
              non-Kekule systems have D3h symmetry and we can use only
              C2v. Thus, we do not have good control over degenerate
              orbitals. Thus, sometimes a bit of experimenting was
              necessary in order to balance the choice of orbitals and
              not to let one degenerate component in the active space
              and the other one in the virtual space.<br>
              <br>
              The size of 7 orbitals is certainly not a hard limit, it
              was chosen out of convenience. I am even not sure at the
              moment whether all cases calculated have the same CAS size
              at CASSCF level. As I said before, it is more the choice
              of the reference space for the AQCC calculation which is
              important for us.<br>

                        the material that Anita provided, it&#39;s clear
                        that you&#39;ve decided not to include the entire

                        phenalenyl, the full =CF=80 space would be 13
                        orbitals.=C2=A0 However, your CASSCF calculations
                        limited the space only to seven MOs.=C2=A0 From
                        looking at the ROHF or UHF orbital energies for
                        that system, I can see why this would be a good
                        idea, as those seven MOs have rather isolated
                        energies (more than 0.1 Eh away from their
                        nearest energetic neighbors).=C2=A0 Furthermore, I
