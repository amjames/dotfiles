Concerning the vans for MRPSS airport pickup/dropoff:

As of Right now this is the schedule I have for arriving flights on =
Sunday.=20

*Arrivals MRPSS:
A bunch of people are driving, and even a large chunk of the =
international students are arriving together in Washington DC, and then =
renting a car to drive the rest of the way.  So it is:

10:11 AM =E2=80=94 Peng Bo
2:11 PM =E2=80=94 Elvis Maradzike
8:46 PM =E2=80=94 Matt Barclay=20
3:40 PM =E2=80=94 Daniel Nascimento=20

I do not need a van for this I can just get them in my car.=20

Two students still need to let me know when they are arriving, but even =
if they both are flying in at the same time as one of these people above =
I can fit three in my car.  I don=E2=80=99t think it is worth the money =
to rent a van.  I am assuming the two of them will fly because one is =
from India and  one is from Sweden.=20

Does that sound okay?=20

*Returning MRPSS
The Students from the MRPSS going back to the airport are split between =
Friday the 3rd and Saturday the 4th. I think we can send them all on the =
Smartway bus. The earliest flight is 7:30AM so I can drive that one if =
it is too early for the bus. The latest is 5:45 PM. The website does not =
say anything about reduced service on the Fourth of July.=20


=E2=80=94AJ
