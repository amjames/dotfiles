Hello,


I'm a 2nd year graduate student studying computational chemistry at the Uni=
versity of Florida. I am interested in applying for the software-developmen=
t summer school, however, I have one question about the application process=
. On the application page it asks me to upload a resume, but on the home pa=
ge it says a CV is required. Which one should I upload?


Thanks in advance!

Justin Smith
