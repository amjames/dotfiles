If not - please do so (through the Motor Pool website).   I know Harley is,=
 but I'll need a couple of vans to transport folks... I can also help if ne=
eded.
Do we want to ask Ashutosh to drive too?  (not sure of his confidence behin=
d the wheel of a 12-person van!)

Also AJ:  I was talking with Jessica Brow at CE this morning and she shows =
39 for the Software Summer School (not the 42 that Daniel and I discussed t=
his morning).  She also needs to know if anybody is coming early or staying=
 late. She received the housing contracts for both schools today and needs =
to know if extra nights are needed for anybody at either end.  Not sure if =
you have that information, but it will be needed!

There will no doubt be many other points to iron out, but I'd like to get t=
he vans reserved so please get registered!  THANK YOU!

Laurie
