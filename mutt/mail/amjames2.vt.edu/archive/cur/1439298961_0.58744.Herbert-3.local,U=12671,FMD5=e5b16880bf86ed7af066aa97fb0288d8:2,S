Hey Dad, 

    I think I am going to have to leave tech.  I don't know what else to
    do.  I am not allowed to register for classes becasue I have a
    parking ticket but nothing is showing up in thier system for my jeep
    or the new car.  I have no way to pay thier fine (even though I have
    no idea where it is comming from) so I am not allowed to sign up for
    classes and I am beging dropped from the program.  The people who
    work for this school are real shits anyway I don't want to be here. 

    Let me know when I can come back :(
