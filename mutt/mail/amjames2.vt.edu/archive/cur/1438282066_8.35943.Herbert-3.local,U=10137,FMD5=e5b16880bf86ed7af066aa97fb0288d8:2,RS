Dr. Crawford,

This student just sent me their travel plans and it looks like he is =
registered for both summer schools.  I don=E2=80=99t know how I didn=E2=80=
=99t notice before, but what should I tell him. Since the SSS is funded =
can the student participate in both? I recall that Kaye Archer wanted to =
do both also.  It looks like they have already booked a flight to arrive =
on June 21st and leave on July 4th. =20
