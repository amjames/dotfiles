An announcement has been added in the "Gen Chem TA Site S15" site at Scholar (https://scholar.vt.edu/portal)



Subject: Submitting final grades


Group: Site


Message: 


All - I will upload the final exam scores after May 7. During this time please try to get your grading finalized and into scholar. I will let you know when to submit the final grades. I'm having trouble with scholar changing settings - specifically the percent each grade category is worth, and the grading scale. After I confirm is everything is correct, then I send a note letting you know to upload the grades into HokieSpa. So as a recap:

DO NOT PUT YOUR FINAL GRADES INTO HOKIE SPA UNTIL I INDICATE YOU SHOULD DO SO!

On the same vein - please know, you are not finished with your TA duties until all the grades are finalized and loaded into HokieSpa!

Thanks, and I appreciate all hard work this semester! Good luck with your finals - thanks, Vicki Long
