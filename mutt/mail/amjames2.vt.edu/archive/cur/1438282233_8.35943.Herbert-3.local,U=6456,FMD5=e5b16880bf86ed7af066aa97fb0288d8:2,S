Hello Dr. Mayhall,

I am Andrew James (AJ) a first year student in Dr. Crawford=E2=80=99s Group=
 at
Virginia Tech, we got to meet during recruitment weekend.  I am writing to
ask if you would be a member of my PhD advisory committee.

During the second semester of the first year I am supposed to select 3
faculty members to make up my advisory committee along with Dr. Crawford.
The committee members responsibilities include grading my programatic
assessments such as the Literature Review, Prelim exam, original research
proposal, and finally the defense.  There is also a requirement that we
have an assessment meeting once a year, however, in many cases one of those
assessments I have already listed will count for that meeting.

There is a form that the committee members normally sign to show they agree
to be a committee member.  This form is my =E2=80=9Cplan of study=E2=80=9D;=
 it states when
I plan on completing all of the requirements of the degree, and the
additional courses I plan to take.  Dr. Morris has said they would accept
an email from you in place of a physical signature.  I can send you that
document so you can look it over once I have all of my committee members
confirmed.  Please let me know if you are able to be on my committee.

Regards,
AJ
