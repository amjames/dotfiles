Good morning all - a few end of the lab comments!

1. The Student Perceptions of Teaching (SPOT) questionnaire has now opened =
and will remain open until Thursday, May 7 (Reading Day). SPOT is the unive=
rsity=92s centrally supported method for gathering student feedback on cour=
ses and instruction. As I am the official Instructor for the General Chemis=
try Laboratories, I am listed as the Instructor. However, this is an evalua=
tion of your TA, not of me.=A0 These evaluations are anonymous and TAs (and=
 myself) do not see the results until the semester is over. We value your o=
pinion and comments. If your TA did something you found helpful, let him/he=
r know. If you have suggestions for improvement for your TA, let him/her kn=
ow that as well, Be as specific as you can. Written comments are especially=
 valuable in helping the TAs to improve and also in helping us improve the =
General Chemistry lab program.

2. If you have specific comments that you would like to provide regarding t=
he laboratory curriculum then please send those comments directly to me via=
 email (vilong@vt.edu). I am especially interested in receiving feedback re=
garding the 12 experiments. Which experiments did you like most and least, =
and why. Which experiments did you have the most difficulty with and why? W=
hat changes, additions, improvements would you like to see.

3. As this is the first semester we moved to prelab quizzes rather than pre=
lab questions for experiments 7 through 12 I would like some feedback. Did =
you prefer the quizzes to the questions, did you feel the questions were of=
 the right level of difficulty, did the questions adequately prepare you fo=
r the upcoming experiment, etc.

4. Also, I would very much like some feedback regarding the online chat, po=
wer point presentations, and afternoon help sessions with the TAs. Did you =
find this helpful, did you use the help - why or why not, what would you li=
ke to see happen differently, were the hours convenient with your schedule,=
 did you feel having a dedicated TA for help was effective, do you have any=
 specific comments for any of these TAs, etc. These comments can also be se=
nt directly to me via email (vilong@vt.edu).

5. I will not post the grades for the final exam until after May 7. The exa=
m is on a scale of 0 to 100. The final exam grades will not be curved. If y=
ou are missing a grade after they are posted, then we're working to resolve=
 the issue. In most cases students IDs were not entered or read correctly. =
There will be no opportunities for any extra credit work.

6. Finalizing lab grades; the TAs are working hard to finish all the gradin=
g. Please remember the TAs also have final exams as well for their own clas=
ses, so they need time to study as well as finishing grades. If there is a =
question regarding your posted grades, please email your TA, giving them su=
fficient time to reply. If your concern remains after contacting your TA, t=
hen please email me.

I'll send one final note after the final exam grades have been posted. Than=
ks, and good luck with the rest of the semester! Victoria Long
