Hello Varun, Erik, and Mohammad, =20

I have joined these email threads because this information is pertinent =
to all of you.  In order for you to apply for a visa to come to the =
program we will have to fill out some forms here so that international =
affairs can  send the appropriate documentation to the state department =
to go with your visa application.  I will be filling that form out on =
behalf of Dr. Crawford who will be acting as the host faculty for your =
visit.  When you complete the visa application you will be asked to give =
a contact person; Dr. Crawford should be that person.  Any information =
you need for him can be found at his personal webpage:=20

www.crawford.chem.vt.edu/ <http://www.crawford.chem.vt.edu/>

I will require a CV to go with the forms I need to submit.  This is not =
an application, as you have all been registered for the school already. =
I only need the CV as a formality, the international student services =
department is required by US law to have a CV/resume on file for =
academic visitors.  If any of this is unclear please let me know, and I =
will try to clear anything up. Thanks for bearing with me. =20

Varun, If you could just reply to confirm you got this message since we =
had problems using this email address in the past. =20
