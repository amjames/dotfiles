First, I hope you were able to get away to PR with your family safely after=
 yesterday=E2=80=99s weather. The website for the software school is pretty=
 much complete. I have highlighted the last changes to each page in the lis=
t below, and put some final questions in there as well.=C2=A0 The link agai=
n so you don=E2=80=99t have go looking for it.<br>
<br>
(1) The homepage: I changed around the presenters (now instructors) section=
. I added pictures of each and their affiliations. And the topic they will =
talk about. Each name is a link to that persons faculty page and once we kn=
ow who will be coming from software carpentry for certain I can expand that=
 into two separate blocks with their own pictures<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 In the interested students section of the home =
page:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -Do those requirements look good?=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -Where should the documents be se=
nt?<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -What should the deadline be?<br>
<br>
(2) The agenda page:I have put videos/slides Here in the individual panels =
rather than the front page. I don=E2=80=99t entirely love how the side pane=
l looks, and it isn=E2=80=99t really nesesary at this point should I move t=
he videos and slides here?=C2=A0 Should I mention that there will be an act=
ivity the first night to meet the other students?<br>
<br>
(3) The Student page: I put a map in showing Blacksburg and Roanoke with a =
VT icon and a airplane Icon showing the location of the airport and campus =
(that was a lot of fun).<br>
<br>
(4)Miscellaneous details and questions.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -Is the funding information is correct?<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -What should I put as the copyright I have put =
SCIM^2<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -What should be listed as the contact info in t=
he footer of each page?<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -As things are updated I can put a badge next t=
o that heading that says new! or something to that effect, an example is in=
 the first entry on the students page<br>
<br>
(5)Registration: I think I just need the link and it is good to go!<br>
<br>
<br>
Moving to the properties school: I plan on using the same site just swappin=
g the text like we discussed. I think that will be ready to go very quickly=
. I can put it where ever it needs to go I have the site on my laptop right=
 now with all of the details left blank I would just need to fill it in. If=
 you would like them to look slightly different I can change out the pictur=
e and change the orange color to match that picture (not very difficult the=
 way I have modified the template)<br>
<span><font color=3D"#888888"><br>
=E2=80=94AJ<br>
</font></span><br>
PS sorry this is a bit lengthy, but I wanted to make sure we got it all wra=
pped up!<br>
