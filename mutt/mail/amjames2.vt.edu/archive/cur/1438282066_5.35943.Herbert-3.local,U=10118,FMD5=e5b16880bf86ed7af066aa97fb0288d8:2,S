Dear Sir,

This is in response to both the emails I received from you; as I am
attending both the Molecular Response
 and the Computational Chemistry Summer schools.

My flight arrival details are:

Airport:* Roanoke*
Flight no.: *4810*
Expected time of arrival: *08:45 PM* on *21st June, 2015.*

My departure details are:

Airport: Roanoke
Flight no.: 4879
Departure time: *12:55PM* on *4th July, 2015*.

Since I will attend the Computational Chemistry Summer School as well , my
timings bracket the
limits of both the schools; which causes me to stay beyond 2nd July. I hope
this does not cause a
problem on your behalf.

Thanking You
Saswata
