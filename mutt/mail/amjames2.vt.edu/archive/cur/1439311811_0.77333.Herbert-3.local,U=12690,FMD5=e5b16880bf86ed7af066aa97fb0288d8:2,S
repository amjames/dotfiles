Mr. James
There will be no need to email me the vin number I have found the vehicle r=
egistered in Virginia DMV with the same vin number as the New York registra=
tion. The Virginia registration was effective 8/10/15 the vehicle must have=
 been registered to you in New York before that it has a purchase date of 5=
/23/15 on New York and Virginia registration. The photo we have on file mat=
ch the New York information. Let me know if you have any questions.

I can email it to you when I get home (if you recall a series of emails we =
exchanged earlier in the summer, I can't park it on campus because the 200 =
some-odd dollars you took out of my paycheck wasn't enough, after I totaled=
 by jeep you wanted more money to print a plastic card to hang in my new ca=
r.)

Quite frankly I am fed up with your office, and most of the hoops I have to=
 jump though at this school in general. I think I may have to pursue my deg=
ree at an institution of higher learning, not one focused on taking every c=
ent from graduate students they barely pay in the first place.
