Mr. James,
First off I would like to say thank you for everything you've done this
semester. Second, I believe my lab grades for experiment 4 and 9 are
incorrect. Lab 4 I got a 38/50, which should be an 88 on scholar, it is an
84. For lab 9 I got a 41/50, which should be a 91, but scholar says it is
an 88. Please look at this for me, if you want me to show you the graded
reports that were given back to me I will gladly do so.
Thanks and have a good summer!
-Nick Snodgrass
