The code in question compiles fine for me with icpc 13.0 and icpc 15.0, as well as gcc 4.8, so unfortunately I can't reproduce your errors, but I'll see what advice I can give you.  For starters, I know these template errors can be hard to read, so I'll dissect it.  Basically on line 230 of Table.h the compiler is trying to find a default constructor for the `TableData` class and one doesn't exist.  However, looking at line 231 of Table.h, in the repository, shows that there is an explicit call to `TableData::TableData(const T&,const int, const int,const int )`, so I don't understand why the compiler would try to invoke the default constructor.

My suggestions: ensure your Table.h is up to date.  If that's true, try replacing the forward declaration of `TableData` on line 117 with the actual definition from lines 177-211.  It's possible, although not correct according to the C++ standard, that somehow the compiler isn't handling the `TableData` class that is a member of `Table` correctly because it's only forward declared.  The use of the forward declaration there is purely stylistic, so if getting rid of it removes the error, I would say check the fix in.  I don't really have any other suggestions
