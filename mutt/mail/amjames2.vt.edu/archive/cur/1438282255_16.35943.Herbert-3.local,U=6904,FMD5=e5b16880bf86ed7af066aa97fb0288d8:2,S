The quality of teaching is important at Virginia Tech, which is why we strive to enhance your learning experience while recognizing good teaching and providing constructive suggestions for instructors.  We cannot accomplish this without your feedback. The SPOT survey takes only minutes to complete, but it provides instructors and department chairs with important information to improve teaching and course content.
