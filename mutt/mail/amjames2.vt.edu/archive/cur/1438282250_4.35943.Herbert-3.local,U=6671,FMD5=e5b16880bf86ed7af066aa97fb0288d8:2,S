Hi, folks,

See David Sherrill's note below about a seminar by Sebastian Wouters.  If
you'd like to listen in (and if your schedule allows), response to Prof.
Sherrill directly.  I'm not able to participate due to other commitments.

Hi Daniel,

   Sebastian is visiting us next week to incorporate his DMRG code
into Psi4.  He is going to give 2 talks, one on DMRG in general, and
one on his code.  We could set up a Google hangout if you or any of
your group is interested.  This is tentatively going to be Tues
afternoon starting at 1pm with a break in between the talks.

David
