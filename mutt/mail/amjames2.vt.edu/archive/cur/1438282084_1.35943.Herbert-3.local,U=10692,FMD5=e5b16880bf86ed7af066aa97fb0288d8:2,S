Just ordered a 6-passenger van in Harley's name, AJ. So unless it's not ava=
ilable, I think we're OK.  (we could also get a car too as a backup plan)
Here's my cell number in case I'm needed for pickup duty!  808-7315
Both vans are scheduled for pickup at 4:00 PM on Friday- but often we get a=
n email to say come-and-get-it earlier than the scheduled time.  I didn't p=
ut this in the notes, but tell them the van won't be used on Saturday at al=
l.  I think they offer some discount in instances when a vehicle is unused.
Next decision is breaks during the summer schools!

Laurie,

Harley and I just looked over the list of departure times.
I think a second 11-passenger van might be overkill but a second vehicle is=
 a good idea (can we get a smaller van?).

Our trip schedule and the student arrivals grouped by time vicinity is atta=
ched. (sheet two Pickup plan)

If we can't get a second vehicle like a minivan or something there would be=
 one immediate turn around, and either harley or I could pick up the loner =
(in blue) at 6:15 in a car while the other takes the van for the next two a=
t 8:00 PM. Let me know what you think or if you need/want me to come by to =
talk this over.

Thanks for your help!
-AJ
