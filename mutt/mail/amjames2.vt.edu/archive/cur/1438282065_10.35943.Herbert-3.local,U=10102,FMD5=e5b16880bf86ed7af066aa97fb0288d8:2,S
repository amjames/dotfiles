I did not realize that conference services was telling everyone that =
they would have to be out on the first. They have told me that staying =
until the second would be no problem.  I am glad you were able to change =
the flight. Unfortunately the budget for the school has all been =
allocated I am very sorry for the mistake, but I don=E2=80=99t see how =
we could reimburse your fee.=20
