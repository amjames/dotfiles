Hi Jessica,=20

I wanted to check if either of those last two students from the SSS had =
registered yet, I sent them a reminder, but I haven=E2=80=99t heard from =
them. =20

I also got a request from two of the SSS students MohammadMahdi Shafiei, =
and Neda Ojaghlou; they are married and requested to be in the same =
room.  I don=E2=80=99t know if the dorms are gender specific or if these =
are one person rooms, so I said I would check, but I didn=E2=80=99t say =
yes or no. Do you know if this is something we can arrange?=20

Thanks Jessica,=20
Andrew=20
PS:
I have gotten a lot more responses from the SSS students, I should have =
a (near) complete list of arrival dates to send you by Monday!=20=
