Justin ... which q should I be using now for testing purposes?  The
machine seems pretty busy right and both normal_q and dev_q are not
turning things around (I need only 1-4 nodes for a few jobs that each
would run only 1 minute or 2).

Will there be a dedicated q for the workshop?  Again, the students
will only need to run short jobs but esp when we are doing MPI having
up to 16 nodes dedicated to the students would be good.

Thanks

Robert
