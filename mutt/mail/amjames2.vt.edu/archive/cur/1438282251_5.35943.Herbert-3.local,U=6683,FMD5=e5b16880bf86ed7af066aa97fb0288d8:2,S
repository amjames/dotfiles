Laurie,

Can you help me to find out two (really three) things:

(1) How many (if any!) registrations have we received for the Molecular
Response Properties Summer School (which I will abbreviate MRPSS from now
on to avoid typing all that).  Also, can you find out if a Varun Kundi from
India has registered?

(2) It appears we may have participants at the MRPSS that need a VISA to
travel to the U.S.  Can VT Conference Services help us to obtain those?

-TDC
