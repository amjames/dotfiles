Andrew,
These students are not Virginia Tech students: they are visitors--correct?
Which building(s) will be used for this event?
Thanks,

To whom it may concern,=20

I am the coordinator for the 2015 Summer School for Software Development in=
 Computational Chemistry, Bimolecular Simulation and Materials Modeling, wh=
ich will be held at Virginia Tech June 22 - July 1st of this year.  While t=
he majority of invited students will be arriving by plane we expect some (<=
20) to drive to campus.  What will I need to do to make sure that these stu=
dents have somewhere to park? How do I go about getting them permits in adv=
ance of their arrival?

Thank you,=20
