Dear Andrew,

I just looked at my grade on the final and it is really surprising. I though=
t I did a decent job and it says I got a 62%. Now my final grade is an 89.79=
% which does not get rounded up. Is there anything anyway I can look at my  t=
est or something? I don't see how I went from doing well in the class to an 8=
9.79.
