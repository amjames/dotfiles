Erik,

It is great to hear that you will still be joining us!

To pay the registration fee you can go to this link:

http://www.cpe.vt.edu/reg/pss/pss.pdf=20

If you are going to pay by credit card you can fax this form to the =
number on the right hand side, or mail it to the address given.  If you =
plan to pay by any other method you can call the phone number on the =
right hand side above the fax number to speak to someone in the office. =
I believe they can process some kinds of payment over the phone as well. =
They will have the best information on how to get your payment thorough. =
=20

You can ignore the date on the form it is incorrect and your payment =
should still be accepted. If you have any trouble please let me know!=20

Regards,=20
