Hi,=20

There are two students, Eric Alt and Tanmoy Sanyal, who are not arriving =
on Sunday. =20

Laurie,
Eric is flying in on Monday afternoon ( 2:11 PM). There is a smartway =
bus that leaves the airport at 2:35 PM, so I think he could take that =
bus if no-one was able to drive out to get him. I am not very concerned =
with the first day of lectures so I would be fine with going to pick him =
up as well. Tanmoy is getting in at 11:00 PM on Saturday night. I was =
planing to go out to the airport and get him since the bus doesn=E2=80=99t=
 run that late.

Jessica,=20
What should I do with these two? Tanmoy is flying in at 11:00 PM on =
Saturday, so I likely won=E2=80=99t have him back to campus until close =
to midnight.  Eric is getting here in the middle of the day on Monday, =
so I don=E2=80=99t think that should be too big of an issue. Can I get =
their room keys and just drop them off at the dorms? Or will someone =
need to meet us that late at night?

Thanks,
=E2=80=94AJ =20=
