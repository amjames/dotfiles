Unfortunately there is not anything we can do at this point.  The score =
is the score, I am not really able to discuss specific grades over =
email, but looking at things objectively you still have a very good =
grade.  It may not seem like it by your own expectations of yourself but =
it is a very good grade, and remember the course is only one credit. If =
there was anything I could do to help you I would, but as far is this =
class goes the grades are final, and the course is over. I=E2=80=99m =
sorry :( =20

Have a nice summer,=20
