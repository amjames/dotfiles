That looks excellent, AJ!  I love the image and the color scheme.  The
whole thing has a very professional feel to it.

Tomorrow I'll give you lots of details for the instructors and such, and
I'll try to get the registration link from the VT conference services
folks.  After the S2I2 site is in place, we can try to get the response
property version up and running quickly, as well.  I'd like to advertise
the schools over the weekend, if possible.

Thanks for putting this at the top!  Let's discuss it at lunch tomorrow.
