Hi Andrew,

Is there any information available on where on the VT campus software  
development summer school participants should go to check in this  
Sunday? Also, is there any available information on travel  
arrangements to VT from the Roanoke airport? I just want to make sure  
I know where I need to be, and how I'm going to get there.

Thanks,

John
