Dr. Crawford,=20

Just a quick update:

I put a VT logo in the top left of the page, and fixed all of the =
misspellings of Virginia (on the software school pages as well).  I also =
added some space between the title and the "register now=E2=80=9D button =
so that the text below it is forced onto the darker part of the image =
making it easier to read. I also changed the page icon. It is what =
should appear next to the page title in the tab (on chrome/firefox) It =
is the chemistry hokie-bird now not the square SICM logo anymore. =20

I also have noticed something that you might find helpful. If you have a =
site that you want to edit hosted with vt hosting services you can mount =
the directory on your mac and the navigate to it through the terminal =
(If you want to have an alternative to using something like =
dreamweaver).

(1)go to the =E2=80=9Cgo=E2=80=9D menu in the top menu bar while finder =
is open
(2)Select connect to server on the dropdown
(3)In the server address field enter =
=E2=80=9Chttps://webdav.hosting.vt.edu/www.theory.chem.vt.edu =
<https://webdav.hosting.vt.edu/www.theory.chem.vt.edu>=20
(4) you will be asked for a name and password, enter your PID as the =
name and your password=20
(5) Now the top directory for theory.chem.vt.edu =
<http://theory.chem.vt.edu/> is mounted under /Volumes, so to make =
changes to the page I can cd to =
=E2=80=9C/Volumes/www.theory.chem.vt.edu/response =
<http://www.theory.chem.vt.edu/response>=E2=80=9D and make any changes I =
need to!

Sorry to be bombarding your inbox while you are on vacation, but I =
wanted to let you know I fixed those things.

First, I hope you were able to get away to PR with your family safely =
after yesterday=E2=80=99s weather. The website for the software school =
is pretty much complete. I have highlighted the last changes to each =
page in the list below, and put some final questions in there as =
well.&nbsp; The link again so you don=E2=80=99t have go looking for =
it.<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
(1) The homepage: I changed around the presenters (now instructors) =
section. I added pictures of each and their affiliations. And the topic =
they will talk about. Each name is a link to that persons faculty page =
and once we know who will be coming from software carpentry for certain =
I can expand that into two separate blocks with their own pictures<br =
class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the interested students section of the =
home page:<br class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Do those requirements look =
good?<br class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Where should the documents be =
sent?<br class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -What should the deadline =
be?<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
(2) The agenda page:I have put videos/slides Here in the individual =
panels rather than the front page. I don=E2=80=99t entirely love how the =
side panel looks, and it isn=E2=80=99t really nesesary at this point =
should I move the videos and slides here?&nbsp; Should I mention that =
there will be an activity the first night to meet the other students?<br =
class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
(3) The Student page: I put a map in showing Blacksburg and Roanoke with =
a VT icon and a airplane Icon showing the location of the airport and =
campus (that was a lot of fun).<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
(4)Miscellaneous details and questions.<br class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Is the funding information is correct?<br =
class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -What should I put as the copyright I have =
put SCIM^2<br class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -What should be listed as the contact info =
in the footer of each page?<br class=3D"">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -As things are updated I can put a badge =
next to that heading that says new! or something to that effect, an =
example is in the first entry on the students page<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
(5)Registration: I think I just need the link and it is good to go!<br =
class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Moving to the properties school: I plan on using the same site just =
swapping the text like we discussed. I think that will be ready to go =
very quickly. I can put it where ever it needs to go I have the site on =
my laptop right now with all of the details left blank I would just need =
to fill it in. If you would like them to look slightly different I can =
change out the picture and change the orange color to match that picture =
(not very difficult the way I have modified the template)<br class=3D"">
