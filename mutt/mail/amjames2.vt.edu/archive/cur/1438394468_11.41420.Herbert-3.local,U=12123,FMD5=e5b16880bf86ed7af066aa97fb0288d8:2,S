That is my fault. I noticed this morning and I meant to tell you when =
you came through earlier.=20

The occupation numbers printed in the output file are the total =
occupation numbers, not the beta occupation numbers. When I was writing =
the code I copied and pasted the allocation for my beta occupation =
numbers vector to make one for the total occupation numbers.=20
I changed the name of the variable but never the name argument to the =
constructor, so both had the title =E2=80=9CBeta Density Eigenvalues=E2=80=
=9D.=20

The alpha an beta occupation numbers haven=E2=80=99t been printing by =
mistake as well. I had been printing the entire alpha/beta density =
matrices in the past, but I wanted to turn that off and I commented out =
the lines printing the alpha/beta occupation numbers as well.  I fixed =
both in the code earlier today before you came in.  I wanted to ask you =
if I could somehow restart the calculation from a checkpoint so it would =
quickly finish since the converged CC wave function is already saved =
somewhere (I hope). =20
