Hi, Harley and AJ,

The group has been whittled down to the three of us for a little while, but
I still hope we can meet today.  We don't have a topic for group meeting
(to my recollection), so I suggest the three of us meet together in the
conference room at 2:00pm.

AJ, I'd like to discuss the status of your two projects and the summer
school website.  Harley, let's talk about the local-CC response paper, the
upcoming ACS meeting, and your Ph.D. defense.  I'd also like to tell you
both about the Pisa collaboration, and to discuss Jean's arrival and stay
with us.

Please let me know if 2:00pm is acceptable.

--TDC
