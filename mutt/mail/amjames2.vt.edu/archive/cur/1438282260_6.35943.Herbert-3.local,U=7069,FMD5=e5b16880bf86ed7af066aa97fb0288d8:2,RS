Andrew,

I just checked my grades for chem lab after you sent out the email that all
of the grades were in. I was just wondering why I still have a 0 for lab
12. I did the report and I know I turned it in. I also know that my lowest
report gets dropped but I just wanted to know the reason for why there is
no grade at all.

Thanks,
VIdhi Patel
