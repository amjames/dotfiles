Hi Jessica,=20

I just got an email from the one student that had not registered for the =
SSS, but was accepted. He just filled out the registration a few minutes =
ago.  Is it too late for him to get in? If not he said he will get back =
to me quickly with his travel plans, but wanted to hold out for =
confirmation first.

I am sending the list of arrival /departure dates to everyone shortly. =20=


Thanks,
=E2=80=94Andrew=20=
