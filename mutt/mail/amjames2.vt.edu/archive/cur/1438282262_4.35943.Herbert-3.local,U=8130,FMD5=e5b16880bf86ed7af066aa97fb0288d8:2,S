Good morning all - a few quick comments regarding the final exam and grades=
.

1. The final exam grades are posted. The exam is on a scale of 0 to 100. Th=
e final exam grades will not be curved. If you are missing a grade, then we=
're working to resolve the issue. In several cases students IDs were not en=
tered or read correctly. We should have all the missing final exam grades r=
esolved by this afternoon.

2. Laboratory Grades:
We will not send the final laboratory grades to the registrar until the end=
 of regular VT finals. There are still a few laboratory report grades missi=
ng; the TAs are working hard to finish all the grading. Please remember the=
 TAs also have final exams as well for their own classes, so they need time=
 to study as well as finishing grades. If there is a question regarding you=
r posted grades, please email your TA, giving them sufficient time to reply=
. If your concern remains after contacting your TA, then please email me.

3. Grading Scale:
The grading scale is as follows for A and B; C and lower follows the same p=
attern:
91.00 and higher=A0 A
90.00 to 90.99 A-
88.00 to 89.99 B+
81.00 to 87.99 B
80.00 to 80.99 B-
There are no opportunities for extra-credit work, nor will the final course=
 scores be rounded up or down. This is the same grading scale used for the =
past several years Gen Chem 1046 laboratories.

Good luck with your remaining finals and finishing all the coursework for t=
he Spring semester. Have a great summer break, and we'll look forward to se=
eing everyone back on campus for the start of the Fall semester!
Best regards, Victoria Long
