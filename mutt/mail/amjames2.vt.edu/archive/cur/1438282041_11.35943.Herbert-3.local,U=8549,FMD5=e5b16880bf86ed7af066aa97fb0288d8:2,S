Hello Dr. Crawford,=20

I looked over the applications for the SSS.  I have listed 9 students =
below who=E2=80=99s applications I think you may want to review =
yourself. =20

The students listed here did not really give too much detail on the =
programming aspect of their work, or specifically stated they are =
working in the applications of theory and their goal is to learn how to =
script/automate their work.  I was not sure if that fell into the =
intended scope of the program.  I made some notes myself, but in the =
interest of brevity (and not typing all of them up) I left them out of =
this email, let me know if you want me to come by and share them with =
you.=20

Chang Liu=20
Kar Kusler
Matthew Dutra
Megha Anand *
MohammadMahdi Shafiei
Pu Du
Sicheng Li
Tian Shi**
Yi-Jung Tu

The other students very clearly stated in their research statement that =
they are working to implement a particular method or procedure in a =
particular software platform, and their materials suggest they are =
working in a development oriented theory group, so I don=E2=80=99t think =
you really need to look at their application.=20

I will send you a draft of the acceptance email tomorrow, I am waiting =
on the info from parking services still. =20

Thanks,=20
=E2=80=94AJ=20

*This is one of Dr. Schaefer=E2=80=99s students who is a 3rd year, and =
has been working in applications, but is interested in moving into =
method development as a post-doc*
**In addition to the other reason listed above for putting them on the =
list,  this student is also a 4th year**=
