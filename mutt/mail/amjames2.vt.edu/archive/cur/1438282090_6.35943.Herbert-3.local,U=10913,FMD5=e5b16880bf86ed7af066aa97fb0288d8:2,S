Hi Megha,=20

The password reset is actually done manually by a person at 4-help (VT=92s=
 help desk). You will probably receive the email soon.  If you don=92t =
have wireless access by the first day I will have credentials you can =
use. I filled out a request myself just in case something like this =
happens.=20

Take care,
Andrew M. James
