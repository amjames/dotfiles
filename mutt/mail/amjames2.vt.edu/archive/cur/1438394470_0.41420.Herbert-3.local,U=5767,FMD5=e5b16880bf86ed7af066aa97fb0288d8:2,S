I have put together a summery of what I have tried and found out so far. =
I have also made sure you can access the executable of the modified =
version of psi in :=20
~amjames2/installed/psi4_NatOrb/bin

I think the ROHF jobs are getting a segfault because of the sortone =
code.  Inside sortone_ROHF.cc there is a statement that the code =
does=E2=80=99t work with frozen orbitals.  I have tried submitting the =
job with no frozen orbitals to see if It runs.  That will take a bit =
longer to get to where it fails in the first place so I will update you =
on the success/failure.=20

The segfault in the ROHF jobs happens after the information about =
occupied orbitals is printed in the output file.  I made some print =
statements in dipole.cc <http://dipole.cc/> to try and narrow it down =
and found that it is at the line:=20
Pap[i][j] =3D moinfo.opdm[I][J]=20
in dipole.cc <http://dipole.cc/> (line 79 ).=20

I have not made as much progress with the failures in the UHF code. But =
I have an idea:
I am getting a message in the job error file that indicates the program =
is trying to free the same thing=20


*** glibc detected *** /home/amjames2/installed/psi4_NatOrb/bin/psi4: =
double free or corruption (out): 0x0000000005ff8570 ***

/lib64/libc.so.6(+0x75366)[0x2b0f023e3366]

I think this happens becasue I am still trying to use moinfo.opdm for =
UHF, and with the UHF reference I should be using the two different =
opdm=E2=80=99s a and b.=20

The good news is I can=E2=80=99t find any problems with them =
modifications I made to change how many of the NO occupation numbers are =
printed. =20

I have also given you access to the modified source code if you wanted =
to take a look.  It is in:=20

~amjames2/src/psi4/NatOrbs/src =E2=80=A6=20

Do you want to meet to talk about this sometime this week? I think my =
major problem here is not quite understanding how the natural orbitals =
occupations calculation works.=20

I hope this info is able to help.=20
