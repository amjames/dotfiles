Hi Jessica,=20

In addition to the late registration we have an additional change to =
make for the SSS.  Jonathan Vandezande has to get surgery, and will be =
unable to attend. Another student from his group has been given =
permission by Dr. Crawford to take his place.  I also received travel =
plans from the last student Justin Smith last night.  If you could send =
me the latest registration info for the SSS I will update the =
spreadsheet I sent out yesterday and send you a final copy.=20

Thanks!
