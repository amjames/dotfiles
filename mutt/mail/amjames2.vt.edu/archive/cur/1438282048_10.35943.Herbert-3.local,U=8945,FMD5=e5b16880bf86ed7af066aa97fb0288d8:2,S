Dear Jonathon,

Thanks for letting me know. When you arrive on campus you will meet me =
to get your parking pass. When the arrival date draws closer I will send =
out more specific information. =20

Thank you for volunteering for this role. During the program there will =
be sessions where students will work on exercises to put the material of =
the days course into practice.  During these sessions in the beginning =
of the week you are of course encouraged to offer help to those who are =
less experienced.  I myself will be attending and likely doing the same =
in the beginning of the week.  Looking forward to meeting you.

Regards,=20
