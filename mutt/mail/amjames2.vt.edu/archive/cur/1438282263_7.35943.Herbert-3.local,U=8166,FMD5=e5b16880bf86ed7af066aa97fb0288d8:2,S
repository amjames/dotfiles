11. PARTICIPANTS NEEDED FOR MAP-COLORING STUDY - 3rd posting
Want to help developing more intuitive map coloring? Participants are sought for a study that evaluates color use in map reading, which will be used to choose the best locations farmers can plant their crops. In each trial you will be presented with a colored map, all of which show soil types but differ in how they show the amount of available water. Each map has two candidate areas of land; you will be asked to choose which area has more water and therefore is more suitable for planting. If you are 18 years or older and interested in participating, take the survey using your personal computer: https://virginiatech.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_3PMWmeJXM08Vh3v. The session will last approximately 30 minutes. Upon submitting a complete survey, your email will be entered in a random drawing for five $20 VT gift cards. For more information, contact Ayat Mohammed at maaayat@vt.edu.

To those who are graduating this May, good-by and good luck! You will be removed from the listserv in August at the latest. To those continuing, all the best for your summer! Please contact me if you have any questions.
