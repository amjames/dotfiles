Dear Andrew,

Thanks for the information and help offered. However, by that time (June 
1 to July 31) I will already be in Blacksburg conducting a short term 
placement in Virginia Tech (Department of Chemistry), for which I am 
already asking for a VISA, so, hopefully, I won't need an specific VISA 
for the course.

Sincerely,

Javier Cerezo
