Hello Everyone

I wanted to take a chance to send you all a message regarding the problems
we have with formatting the lab reports.  So I made a list you should all
check over before your are done with an assignment to make sure
you don't loose any unnecessary points.

* *Questions:*
* -* all parts of the question should be answered, including a discussion
of any part that a discussion is asked for *using full **sentences*
 - should be in order, if question 1 is to show several graphs that should
be the first thing I see
 - there should only be one copy of each answer some folks have included
duplicates of their answers from previous drafts ect.
 - In the future (starting with what you hand in this week). I will not
grade questions that are out of order, and if multiple copies of an answer
are provided i will take the grade from the answer which is lowest.

* * Tables/Figures *
* - * should be formatted to fit the page, and match the style of the
document (see below). Should have a title and figure caption
 - I will be taking of points if your tables are cut off or are not
finished. printing out the excel sheet with all of your tables on it is not
acceptable
they should be put into word and formatted to fit the page  and match the
document.

**References *
*- * References should be done using the ACS style using the end- note
software. The text should contain in line citations using
super scripts that refer to a particular source in the bibliography.
- Sources should be at the end of the document
- I will not accept references that are not in the ACS format, use end note.
- all references should match the rest of the document formatting

*D*ocument Format*
*- * all reports will be typed using times new roman 12 pt font, and a 1''
margin around the entire document.
- all reports should be double spaced, including references ( I will take
of points for this)
- each page should have the page number and the students last name using
the Microsoft word heading tools
- First page heading
--on the right margin
>Your name
>The date
>My name (Andrew James)
                 (In that order)

--on the left margin
the day/time of your section<
      your lab partner's name<
                    Pre or post lab<
      (In that order)
Then centered in the page above the first question
the experiment title.


As a reminder, email me if you are not sure that you have completed an
assignment.
These reports should take some time, and will start to take longer as the
semester goes on. Print it out the night before and visually inspect all
formatting
"It looked fine on the computer" is not a valid excuse for missing one of
these things above.

Regards,
Andrew
