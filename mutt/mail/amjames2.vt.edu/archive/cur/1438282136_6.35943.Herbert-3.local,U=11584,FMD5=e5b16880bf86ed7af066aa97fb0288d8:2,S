Jessica,=20

It has just come to my attention that the dining hall has truncated their h=
ours this week.  This is problematic because it appears they close dinner a=
t 6:30 PM.  The properties Summer School ends class at 6:00 PM every day gi=
ving the students only a few minutes to eat by the time they walk over to D=
2. Is there anything we can do to fix this?

Thanks,=20
