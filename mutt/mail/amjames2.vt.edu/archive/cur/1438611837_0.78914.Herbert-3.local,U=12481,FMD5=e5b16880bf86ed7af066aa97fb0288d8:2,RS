Good Morning James,

We are unable to provide PDF files of official transcripts as they are 
required to be sealed in a college envelope to be considered official.

Thank you,

Hello, 

I am a graduate from the class of 2014, and I require a copy of my
offical univeristy transcript.  I see through the online portal the
option to have printed coppies mailed somehwere, or to download and
print my un-offical transcript.  However, I need a pdf of the
transcript. Could you tell me where I can download that. 

Thanks,
Andrew M. James
