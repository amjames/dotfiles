I usually warn against using unsigned types for those kinds of things because subtraction can be a problem. Any time you want the difference between two unsigned types you have to check first which one is larger, rather than just doing abs() on the difference. (It's considered a mistake by some that many STL containers/functions return size_t).

Not sure how often that comes up, but it turns into a pain. And by the time you start to overflow a signed type, you should be looking at a larger type anyway - that 2x probably doesn't buy you much time.
