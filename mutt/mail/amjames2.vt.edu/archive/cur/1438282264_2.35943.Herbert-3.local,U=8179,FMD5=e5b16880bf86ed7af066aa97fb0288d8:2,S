An announcement has been added in the "Gen Chem TA Site S15" site at Scholar (https://scholar.vt.edu/portal)



Subject: Changing a grade to an F


Group: Site


Message: 


There may be some confusion here. If you need to change a students grade to an F, do this manually in HokieSpa. You can not manually change a grade in scholar. So upload the grades from scholar into HokieSpa, then use the drop box box with the grades and change the grade (most likely a C or less) to an F. Thanks, Vicki Long
