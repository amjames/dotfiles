Jeanette, 

I am sorry for the mix-up. In my state the drivers are not listed on the
insurance cards, so only my father and mother are there.  There is no
error and I have gotten a letter of proof that suffices as proof that I
am a driver on the policy. Thank you for your rapid response. 

Regards,
