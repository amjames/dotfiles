These are great Questions! When writing any report questions like these =
will come up as you think about and reason through your data.  It is an =
important part of the exercise to go to the literature and find the =
answers you are looking for! Or find some information that leads you to =
a conclusion about these questions.  I would suggest you answer these in =
the =E2=80=9CIntroduction=E2=80=9D section (including the proper =
reference and in-text citation(s)). However I can=E2=80=99t help you the =
actual answers, I would start my search in the article from J. Chem. Ed =
that is provided in the lab manual!
