Dear Research Participant (James, Andrew M.):

You are receiving this e-mail because you will be supported on a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored project.  The terms and conditions of the NSF award include a Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training requirement for all undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral associates supported on this project, consequently, you must complete online training in Responsible Conduct of Research.  (The university is using the same definition for postdoctoral associates that is used for reporting to NSF which includes individuals who have received their PhD within the last five years.)

You are required to complete the course within 30 days of this notification.  Throughout the next 30 days you will receive weekly notifications reminding you to complete the course within the 30 day time period.  Your last and final notice will be sent 3 days before the 30 day deadline.  Please do not wait until the last week to complete the course.  Please keep in mind that failure to comply with this policy within the specified time frame may result in the freezing of the account for the project supporting these personnel.

The University has established the following option for satisfying the new NSF requirement:

On-line instruction

Individuals can access an on-line course created and maintained by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), a nationally-recognized source for research-related training.  Please see the below instructions for instructions on how to access the CITI Responsible Conduct of Research online course.   From this point forward, you will receive e-mail notifications from the Office of Research informing you of your responsibility to attend training.
