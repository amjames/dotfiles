You must have read my mind... I was just about to call about this.
Oh why oh why did he pick THAT flight.  Can we canvass the students and see=
 how many need rides back on Saturday?  I can help. We could get another co=
uple of cars.
Or even Friday?  I know the Swedish guy is going back on Friday and please =
tell me his name!!
Make up the departure list/requests and let's just do it.
Af for Mr. 5:45 - we can arrange a Hooptie ride back for him with Daniel's =
OK.  He could be standing outside of East AJ at, what, 4:15 AM?

It is running normally the rest of the week. However on Wednesday July 1st =
Tanmoy Sanyal Has to catch at flight at 5:45 AM.  The earliest bus will not=
