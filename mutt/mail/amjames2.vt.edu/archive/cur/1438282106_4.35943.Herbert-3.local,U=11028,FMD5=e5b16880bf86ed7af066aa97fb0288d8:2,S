Hi James
The rooms are doubles so you will have a room mate. I don't know if you will=
 have a microwave or mini fridge, but I would assume no. When you here you c=
an still go to the same place. There will be a student worker who has your n=
ame on a list and will give you your room key.  If you have have any trouble=
 you can give me a call. My cell number is.=20

Safe Travels,
