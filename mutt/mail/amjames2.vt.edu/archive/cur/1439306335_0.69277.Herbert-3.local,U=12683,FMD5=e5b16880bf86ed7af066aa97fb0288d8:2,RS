That's absolutely ridiculous. Did you talk to someone that's actually in
charge or just some student worker? On the online pay website [linked]
<https://pay.parking.vt.edu/cit/index.aspx> you can enter your student ID
to check for unpaid tickets - have you tried that? If it's linked to your
account (as in if it shows as a hold on your academic account through
HokieSPA) then it only makes sense that you should be able to pull it up
that way.

Also I would be way lonely if you left. And then I could arguably be
considered a crazy cat lady.
