Well how about if we change the reservation to a large car?
SO:  Cancel one van and change the other res to a car?
(these are the 6/26 reservations)
And get you a car for pickup on the afternoon of the 2nd (as we show it) an=
d return it on the 4th of July?

Subject: Re: Current van reservations

Concerning the vans for MRPSS airport pickup/dropoff:

As of Right now this is the schedule I have for arriving flights on Sunday.

*Arrivals MRPSS:
A bunch of people are driving, and even a large chunk of the international =
students are arriving together in Washington DC, and then renting a car to =
drive the rest of the way.  So it is:

10:11 AM - Peng Bo
2:11 PM - Elvis Maradzike
8:46 PM - Matt Barclay
3:40 PM - Daniel Nascimento

I do not need a van for this I can just get them in my car.

Two students still need to let me know when they are arriving, but even if =
they both are flying in at the same time as one of these people above I can=
 fit three in my car.  I don't think it is worth the money to rent a van.  =
I am assuming the two of them will fly because one is from India and  one i=
s from Sweden.

Does that sound okay?

*Returning MRPSS
The Students from the MRPSS going back to the airport are split between Fri=
day the 3rd and Saturday the 4th. I think we can send them all on the Smart=
way bus. The earliest flight is 7:30AM so I can drive that one if it is too=
 early for the bus. The latest is 5:45 PM. The website does not say anythin=
g about reduced service on the Fourth of July.
