Hello,

The Software-Development Summer School is only a few days away, and as you =
get ready to come to Blacksburg we want to share a few details with you.

Check-in and Wireless access:
Arrival and check-in information has been added to the school website<http:=
//www.s2i2.org/school_2015/index.html> under "Students".  There is also ins=
tructions for setting up a guest wireless account which should be completed=
 ASAP. Please remember that the course will involve hands-on examples, so e=
veryone will need a laptop, charger, and internet connection!

School Resources:
We have also added some materials for the School itself under "Resources". =
 In particular Software Carpentry has prepared specific setup instructions<=
http://guyrt.github.io/2015-06-21-s2i2/> that are available here. They can =
also be found under the "Resources" tab.

If you have any questions you can send me an email.
We are looking forward to your arrival!

Regards,
Andrew M. James
