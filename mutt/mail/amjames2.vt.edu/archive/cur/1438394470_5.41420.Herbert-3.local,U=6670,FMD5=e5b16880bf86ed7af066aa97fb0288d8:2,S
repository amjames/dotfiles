                                          It is good to hear about your
                                          progress.<br>
                                          Our procedure concerning the
                                          active orbitals for the CASSCF
                                          is a pragmatic one. First of
                                          all, the CASSCF calculation
                                          does not stand alone, it is
                                          only meant to provide
                                          appropriate orbitals for the
                                          subsequent MRCI and MR-AQCC
                                          calculations. The CAS space
                                          increases exponentially and
                                          very soon gets out of hand. At
                                          the MRCI and MR-AQCC all
                                          orbitals not frozen are
                                          correlated, with the AQCC
                                          calculation even higher
                                          (quadruple) excitations
                                          included explicitly. Thus, our
                                          focus is more on the
                                          construction of the reference
                                          space for MR-AQCC than having
                                          an extensive CASSCF space. For

                                          AQCC calculations and the
                                          analysis of the major
                                          contributions to the
                                          wavefunction were used.=C2=A0 We
                                          have a occupation threshold of

                                          which the NO occupation

                                          DFT orbital energies, to my
                                          knowledge.=C2=A0 She can give mor=

                                          information when needed.
                                          Another point was that the
                                          non-Kekule systems have D3h
                                          symmetry and we can use only
                                          C2v. Thus, we do not have good
                                          control over degenerate
                                          orbitals. Thus, sometimes a
                                          bit of experimenting was
                                          necessary in order to balance
                                          the choice of orbitals and not
                                          to let one degenerate
                                          component in the active space
                                          and the other one in the
                                          virtual space.<br>
                                          <br>
                                          The size of 7 orbitals is
                                          certainly not a hard limit, it
                                          was chosen out of convenience.
                                          I am even not sure at the
                                          moment whether all cases
                                          calculated have the same CAS
                                          size at CASSCF level. As I
                                          said before, it is more the
                                          choice of the reference space
                                          for the AQCC calculation which
                                          is important for us.<br>

                                          Please let me know whether you
                                          have more questions.<br>
