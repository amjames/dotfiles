Hi,=20

I don=E2=80=99t have access to virtulab so I am going to say follow the =
instructions in the book but that comes with an asterisk. You should =
check the online chat to see if anyone has run into the same problem and =
was able to get some help. Looking at the instructions in the book it =
seems pretty straight forward. If your problem is with the interface =
online, then I am sorry but i can not be much help.=20

I hope you are able to sort this out,=20
