Hi Miranda,=20

This is actually a bit tricky of a question. What they are looking for =
you to do is look at your observations and make a reasonable argument =
for why is happening to the protein energetically. You don=E2=80=99t =
have to say which direction the entropy/ enthalpy are changing just if =
you think they have changed and most importantly reason through why in =
the body text of your paper. We are looking for coherent arguments not =
necessarily correct ones.=20

Take Care,=20
