Dear Daniel,

Thank you very much for your e-mail. We are looking forward to your 
results. The most important question from my point of view is whether 
the restricted or the unrestricted approach is the appropriate one (see 
my previous e-mail). I think we should concentrate on that question 
first of all, taking the heptazethrene (str. 4) as example. According to 
your restricted calculations one gets a closed shell state, but our 
multireference calculations and also the UHF density shows the opposite. 
What do you think?

Best regards, Hans

              Andrew,<br>
              <br>
              Thank you for your e-mail and the data.<br>
              Concerning geometry differences: these are very small and
              come from the fact that Anita used Gaussian and Turbomole
              to verify the consistency of the results. She sent you the
              Gaussian optimized geometries but then followed up with
              Turbomole calculations. Finally, we decided to base all
              results on Turbomole and she changed the coordinates in
              the Supp. Mat. I am attaching her comments. You can see
              there that differences are negligible and you need not
              redo the calculations.<br>
              Concerning the question of the symmetry in the UDFT
              geometry optimizations for structures 4-8. These were
              performed for the singlet ground states. The closed shell
              high-symmetry DFT solution is unstable. The spin
              unrestricted (U)DFT wavefunction is symmetry broken and
              has only Cs symmetry. You can see the orbitals  in Figs.
              9S-13S of the Supp. Mat. The C2h in Fig. 10S should also
              read as Cs. Thus, the MOs have Cs symmetry, but alpha and
              beta orbitals are equivalent so that the structural
              symmetry is higher, C2h and D2h, respectively. Thus, the
              formulations should be correct. However, we will explain
              this in the text. See also Anita's comments attached.<br>
              I am also attaching a paper on oligoacenes where you see
              the same effect, the symmetry broken orbitals (Figure 2)
              and the higher symmetry of the geometry.<br>
              <br>
              Do you agree?<br>
              <br>
              Please see my follow-up e-mail on the symmetry breaking.<br>
