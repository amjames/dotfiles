Hi Andrew,

GitHub has nice Fork and PullRequest features =
https://github.com/psi4/psi4public/wiki/1_Obtaining#contribute-back-3 =
<https://github.com/psi4/psi4public/wiki/1_Obtaining#contribute-back-3> =
that are the best way to get your code reviewed before actually merging =
it into the repo.

But, if you didn=E2=80=99t set it up that way, it=E2=80=99s fine. =
Assuming you=E2=80=99re on private, go ahead and pull changes, =
recompile, run a good fraction of tests (ctest -L quicktests), and push =
to private, according to =
https://github.com/psi4/psi4public/wiki/1_Obtaining#clone-from-private-mir=
ror-github-repository =
<https://github.com/psi4/psi4public/wiki/1_Obtaining#clone-from-private-mi=
rror-github-repository> .

Maybe you=E2=80=99d better tell me where your code is now: clone or =
fork, public or private.

No need to catch r/u/ro specially. They can throw the same as if you did =
energy(=E2=80=98elephant=E2=80=99).

Thanks,
Lori
