Hello Fellow Graduate Students,



This email is to let everyone know about the Journal Club for the Physical
Sciences, formerly called the Analytical and Physical Chemistry Journal
Club.  This club is run and attended by graduate students and postdocs from
our department and provides a great forum to discuss current published
research.  It is great practice to talk science, explore research, learn
techniques not directly in your field, and to discover something new.



We are having our first meeting of the semester on January 30th at 3:45 in
room HHN 200 and hope to see some new faces.  If you cannot make the first
meeting but are still interested in attending a meeting, the journal
articles being discussed will be posted on our Scholar site.  Please send
me an email and I will add you to the site.



Kristina Roth
