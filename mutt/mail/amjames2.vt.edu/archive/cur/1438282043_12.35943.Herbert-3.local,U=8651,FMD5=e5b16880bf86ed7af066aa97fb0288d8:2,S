ello Dr. Crawford,<br>
<br>
I looked over the applications for the SSS.=C2=A0 I have listed 9 students =
below who=E2=80=99s applications I think you may want to review yourself.<b=
r>
<br>
The students listed here did not really give too much detail on the program=
ming aspect of their work, or specifically stated they are working in the a=
pplications of theory and their goal is to learn how to script/automate the=
ir work.=C2=A0 I was not sure if that fell into the intended scope of the p=
rogram.=C2=A0 I made some notes myself, but in the interest of brevity (and=
 not typing all of them up) I left them out of this email, let me know if y=
ou want me to come by and share them with you.<br>
<br>
Chang Liu<br>
Kar Kusler<br>
Matthew Dutra<br>
Megha Anand *<br>
MohammadMahdi Shafiei<br>
Pu Du<br>
Sicheng Li<br>
Tian Shi**<br>
Yi-Jung Tu<br>
<br>
The other students very clearly stated in their research statement that the=
y are working to implement a particular method or procedure in a particular=
 software platform, and their materials suggest they are working in a devel=
opment oriented theory group, so I don=E2=80=99t think you really need to l=
ook at their application.<br>
<br>
I will send you a draft of the acceptance email tomorrow, I am waiting on t=
he info from parking services still.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

*This is one of Dr. Schaefer=E2=80=99s students who is a 3rd year, and has =
been working in applications, but is interested in moving into method devel=
opment as a post-doc*<br>
**In addition to the other reason listed above for putting them on the list=
,=C2=A0 this student is also a 4th year**</blockquote></div><br></div>
