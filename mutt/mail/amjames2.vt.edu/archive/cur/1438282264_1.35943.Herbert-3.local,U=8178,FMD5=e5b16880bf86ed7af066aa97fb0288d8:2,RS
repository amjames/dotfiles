No, the easiest way is to upload the grades, and then in HokieSpa change th=
e
students grade from what is most likely a C to an F using the pull down box
in HokieSpa. Let me know if this isn=B9t clear =AD thanks, Vicki

(Scholar will not let you change a grade manually)

Mrs. Long,=20

Just a bit confused on your instructions here.

If I have a section on the list am I supposed to upload the grades into
hokiespa after I manually change the grade to an F? I will hold off on
uploading my section on the list until you say so.

Thanks
