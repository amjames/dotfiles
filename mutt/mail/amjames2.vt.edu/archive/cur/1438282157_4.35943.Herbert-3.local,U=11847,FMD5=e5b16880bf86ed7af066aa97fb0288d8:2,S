I found this link in the anaconda documentation fort help installing =
into the anaconda framework. It would seem that if the package is in the =
anaconda repositories you can do

$ conda install <pkg-name>=20

this is their alternative to the normal python package index =E2=80=9Cpip"=


if it is not included in the anaconda repositories you may have to build =
from source ( which is normally easy for python packages, you just have =
to run the setup script in the source tree after you unpack the tarball, =
then modify the $PYTHONPATH envar to let python =E2=80=9Csee=E2=80=9D =
the module)
