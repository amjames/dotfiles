The Flyer:
I mentioned the idea to Dr. Crawford about making it and we haven=E2=80=99=
t discussed it much since then. I don=E2=80=99t think its absolutely =
critical, but if we get something we like i would go over to Kinkos to =
get them printed.=20

Also for the flyer: Do we have a set time or place for the Sunday =
reception (is that still happening). I have not gotten much in the way =
of details about that.=20

The Wed/ Sunday thing:
Yes, Sunday the 28th is when most of the Students for the Response =
Properties School Will be arriving. Thankfully there is not as many of =
them, and only a few are flying. The one I have to get at 8:46 PM is the =
last one.  That is why I think wed. would be a better idea, except a =
good number of the students are leaving on Wednesday, so they wouldn=E2=80=
=99t be able to go. We could get the smaller than 40 group rate though..=20=


Bowling:
I love the idea! I think its a much better idea than just having like a =
dinner or something; people are free to mingle while they eat a bit and =
bowl. I don=E2=80=99t know how it plays into the budget, but if it works =
I think we certainly should!

Instructors:
ok, Phew.. I had a little panic attack that I had missed something =
major.=20
