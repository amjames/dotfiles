Okay great. I will send an email shortly with more information and =
announce some updates to the school website.  For your information =
though, check in will take place in new-hall west

The driver should be familiar enough with the VT campus to find it. If =
not there will be a google map on the website with it marked.=20

Check-in will take place here and the desk is open 24/7

Take care!
