Hi Andrew,

I think this should be done be the host not the applicants. In the link =
you emailed me, it says:

The Virginia Tech hosting faculty and/or departments (NOT the =
international visitor) should complete the Export Questionnaire =
<http://www.oesrc.researchcompliance.vt.edu/international-visitors> and =
send along with the visitor's CV to the Office of Export and Secure =
Research Compliance (OESRC) at  <mailto: <script type=3D'text/javascript'>=
 <!-- var prefix =3D 'ma' + 'il' + 'to'; var path =3D 'hr' + 'ef' + '=3D';=
 var addy77067 =3D 'oesrc' + '@'; addy77067 =3D addy77067 + 'vt' + '.' + =
'edu'; document.write('<a ' + path + '/'' + prefix + ':' + addy77067 + =
'/'>'); document.write(addy77067); document.write('<//a>'); //-->/n =
</script><script type=3D'text/javascript'> <!-- document.write('<span =
style=3D/'display: none;/'>'); //--> </script>This email address is =
being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. =
<script type=3D'text/javascript'> <!-- document.write('</'); =
document.write('span>'); //--> </script>.>oesrc@vt.edu =
<mailto:oesrc@vt.edu>.

And the questionnaire requires the signature of the faculty in the end.

Regards,

Mohammad
