Hello,=20

I have mailed the request to my undergraduate Institution to have my =
official transcripts sent.  If under any circumstances the transcript =
does not arrive in the next 2 weeks. Please let me know immediately. The =
registrar at Marist College  is notoriously bad at fulfilling these =
requests, and there is a high probablility  that they will forget to =
send it.=20


Thank you
