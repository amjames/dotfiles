I received the following information for students who will require visa =
letters, you will need to follow the link below to request Virginia Tech =
international services so send a letter on your behalf.  I am told it is =
a fairly easy process.=20
http://www.iss.vt.edu/index.php/vt-department-host/visitor-b-visa-waiver =
<http://www.iss.vt.edu/index.php/vt-department-host/visitor-b-visa-waiver>=


When completing the visa application you are required to provide a =
contact person.  That person Should be professor T. Daniel Crawford any =
of the information needed such as an address or email, can be found at =
his personal web page.
http://www.crawford.chem.vt.edu/ <http://www.crawford.chem.vt.edu/>

I apologize for the delay in getting this information to you; we were =
not expecting such a large interest from outside the US, and had to =
gather this information rather quickly.  If any of this is confusing or =
you have any other questions please do not hesitate to contact me. =20

Thanks=20
