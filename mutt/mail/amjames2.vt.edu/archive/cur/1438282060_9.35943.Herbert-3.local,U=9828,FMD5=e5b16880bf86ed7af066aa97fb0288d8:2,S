Excellent.  I'll get the vans ordered then!  So we'll have to pick them up =
on Friday, and return on Monday morning I guess.
Daniel and I also talked about having an evening event at the new bowling a=
lley - they have some fun packages - so we'd need vans for that too.
And then vans to get them back.
I'll keep you posted!

Dear Laurie,

I have already registered with Fleet Commander last week.

I reported 42 for the SSS incorrectly. I should have said 41, but that is t=
he number of applications we have accepted so far. I think Jessica may have=
 been reporting the number of those who have come back to formally register=
 for the school. I don't have access to see the registration numbers  so I =
have to ask Jessica for an update every so often.  Either way I only have g=
otten travel plans from 15students so far.  I am going to send out a remind=
er to those I am still waiting to hear from.

Thanks,
--AJ

There will no doubt be many other points to iron out, but I'd like to get t=
