Hey Andrew,

I know it is a super busy part of the year for everyone right now, which is
why I was wondering if there was any chance you have graded the last few
lab reports (so I can decide if I should do the last one)? I am missing
Energy/Environment, GCMS, and Heavy Metals. I completely understand if you
haven't gotten to them, just thought it would be worth asking. Thanks!

Marie Johnston
