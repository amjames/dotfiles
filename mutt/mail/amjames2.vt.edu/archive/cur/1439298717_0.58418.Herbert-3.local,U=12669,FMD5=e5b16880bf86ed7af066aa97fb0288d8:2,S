Hello, 

    My Hokie spa account says that I have an account hold for a past due
    parking ticket.  I called the office and the woman who answered the
    phone was not very much help and quite rude, but she informed me
    that the ticket was issued in June.  The car I registered with VT
    was a black 2003 Jeep Wrangler NY plate ERU-5208. Which does not
    show any tickets in your system.  My new car, which I was driving by
    the beginning of June, a red 2015 Mazda 3 hatchback VA plate
    VHY-2731. Does not show any tickets either. Since I have not gotten
    a physical ticket any every vehicle I have driven apparently doesn't 
    either I would like to know how you expect my to pay the ticket. 

    I never got a permit for my mazda because you wanted my to pay 20
    dollars for it. I decided that the over 200 I had already paid you
    was more than enough and I elected not to drive to school for the
    last two months. What I am really saying here is that I know the
    ticket was incorrectly put on my account (for whatever reason) and
    it needs to be removed by the end of the day. If the hold is still
    on my account this time tomorrow I will not hesitate to escalate the
    issue.  
   
Andrew M. James
