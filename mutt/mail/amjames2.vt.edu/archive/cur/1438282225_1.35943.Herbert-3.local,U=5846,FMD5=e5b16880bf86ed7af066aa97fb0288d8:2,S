First,
I think you may be confusing the entropic arguments for crystalline =
structures to that of portions clathrates are crystalline molecules that =
have free molecules of another species regularly distributed throughout =
the lattice. Portions suffer from an entropic conundrum. The folding of =
a portion into a compact form violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics (at =
first glance). Therefore the enthalpic benefits of a protein folding =
must outweigh its entropic cost. =20

Second,=20
The change in enthalpy is related to the intermolecular forces that hold =
the protein in its active (folded conformation).  If something you add =
is able to stabilize those IMF=E2=80=99s then it will stabilize the =
protein ( a negative enthalpy  change). If those molecules are for some =
reason interrupting these IMFs then the change in enthalpy will be =
positive as some of the stabilizing forces have been lost.=20

I hope this helps,=20

understand that the change in entropy for a folded protein is positive =
because of the release of the clathrates. I am confused on the enthalpy =
part. Is the enthalpy always positive (unfavorable) for a folded =
protein? The lab manual doesn't clarify this very well.=20
