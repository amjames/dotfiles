Okay,
so...
1 (the one you said would be best in the previous correspondence, but I
would have to pay to upgrade to 4 gb ram)
http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x140e/

2. Different lenovo yoga from before
http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/yoga-laptop-series/yoga-2-11-black/

3. The cheaper model
 http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/u-series/u430p/

4. Acer
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Acer-Aspire-V3-111P-P6VM-Touchscreen-Laptop/productID.304808900

5.Dell
http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-11-3147-laptop/pd?ref=PD_Family


The VGA port thing would be nice but is, ultimately, unnecessary due to the
accessories I've acquired, btw.
Thanks a bunch  =)
