There seems to have been a misunderstanding between me and the consortium
that fund my registration.

I will attend, and to clear this out i have contacted Uppsala University to
sort out the payment details. I will get back to you later this week or as
soon as i have solved this issue.

Sorry for any inconvenience. Have a great day!
