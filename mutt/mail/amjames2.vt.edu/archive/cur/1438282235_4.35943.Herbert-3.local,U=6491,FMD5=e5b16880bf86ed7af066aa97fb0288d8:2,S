To: Chem 1046 TA Group<p/>From: Michelle Dalton<p/>Good Morning,<br/>
<br/>
For the pesticides lab, please show your students the amended procedure that is located at each station.<br/>
<br/>
Also show them what the homogenizers look like and how they are to be used on the vortexer found at the front end of the bench.&nbsp; Please remind them that they are NOT to throw the homogenizers away, but to rinse carefully, as the procedure states.<br/>
<br/>
Students have also said that it is quite helpful to use a plastic pipet to get the applesauce out the of the container.&nbsp; One &quot;squeeze&quot; is too much.<br/>
<br/>
More than likely, more notes to come as the first round of this lab continues.....<br/>
