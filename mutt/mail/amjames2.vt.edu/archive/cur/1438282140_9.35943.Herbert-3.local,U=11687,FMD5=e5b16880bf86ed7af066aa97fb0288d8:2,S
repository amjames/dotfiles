Dear fellow graduate students,

As one of the Chemistry delegates at the Graduate Student Assembly, I want
to share some information with respect to a new parking initiative called
Graduate Preferred Parking. Please see the email below from Mike Chang,
president of the GSA.

Best regards,

    Hi everyone,

The GSA worked hard last year with Parking Services discussing possible
programs to alleviate the difficulties with parking on campus. As a result,
Parking Services has unveiled a new parking pilot program specifically
targeting GAs, GTAs, and GRAs:

http://parking.vt.edu/gradpref.asp

Several things to note regarding the Graduate Preferred Parking Permit:

1.) These are only eligible for graduate students currently at a salaried
GA, GTA, or GRA appointment;
2.) These are slightly more expensive permits, about $20 more total than
the normal G/C permits (same price as faculty permit);
3.) Those who apply are not guaranteed into the program; only 75 spaces
were reserved in Perry St. Lot 3 in this pilot program. The permits will be
available to applicants that were selected by a lottery system.

Check out the website above for more information.

It's not much, but we think it's a good direction for the university to
continue to be mindful of graduate students at VT.

Thanks, and please spread the words!

 -- Matt
