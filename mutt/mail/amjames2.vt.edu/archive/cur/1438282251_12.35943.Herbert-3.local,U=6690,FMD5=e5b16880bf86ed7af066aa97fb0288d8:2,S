Dear Theorists,

this might interest at least some of you.

Thought this might interest you.  Gilbert Strang is a big shot in
mathematical numerical analysis.

Colleagues --

Prof. Gilbert Strang from MIT will be visiting campus on Tuesday, April 21
to deliver a seminar on "Tridiagonal Matrices and Applied Linear Algebra"
as part of the Math Department colloquium and the CMDA Distinguished
Lecture Series, from 4-5pm in Davidson 281.

The talk will be suitable for a broad audience, so I encourage you to
promote the lecture to your classes.  A text version of the abstract
follows below; I have also attached a poster to this email.

Gil, a past president of SIAM, has kindly agreed to meet with students for
lunch before his talk.   That event is being organized by our local SIAM
chapter; details will be forthcoming.

best wishes,

Mark

TRIDIAGONAL MATRICES AND APPLIED LINEAR ALGEBRA
Gilbert Strang (MIT)
Tuesday April 21, 4-5pm, Davidson 281

My favorite matrix has three nonzero diagonals with -1's and 2's
and -1's.  It is like a second derivative  (very useful).  This talk is
about
a much larger family of tridiagonal matrices in applied mathematics:

   1.  How to replace the zeros to reach a full matrix (optimally)

   2.  How to invert that full matrix

   3.  How to find the eigenvalues

   4.  How tridiagonal matrices and their inverses come up in applications.

The ideas extend to other banded matrices but the presentation will turn to
education (linear algebra, differential equations, and computational
science).
Do videos succeed ?  Does online homework succeed (for ideas and not just
practice in repetition) ?  Do applications help or interfere ?  Hard
questions.
