Oh stop being a raincloud, darling.
I'm sorry I've been grumpy, I've just felt really overwhelmed and worthless
lately but it doesn't have anything to do with you and I'm sorry if I let
my problems affect our relationship. I like being with you; it isn't your
job to "keep me happy" and I appreciate you being patient with me in the
mornings - I'll start being better.

We can figure something out with the parking issue. If you want to vent
about it feel free to bitch out all the details but if you need to start
doing something else, then let's talk about it later. Worst case scenario -
we'll start parking at University City Mall and take the bus to campus or
walk over, no big deal.

Cheer up, buttercup. I love you but we're too young to get married to fix
our problems. (that was a joke, smile).

(There's a comic strip attached below - you maybe can't see it in your
email program so I wanted to mention it.)
