Well, I guess you have your answer about whether you should keep working on
the UHF-NOs. :)

Are you first carrying out a spin projection of the density?  That seems to
me to be the first step.

Also, I am able to converge the UHF wave function in Cs symmetry after the
stability analysis, but I had to pull new code from master a few days ago
to do it.  Jerome found some errors in his eigenvector following function
and checked in the fix.
