Dear Sir or Madam, 

    This is the second time that I have contacted this office 
    regarding an erroneous charge on my account. This charge is now
    affecting my registration status, and due to some apparent oversight
    your office failed to remove it after my last message.  This is the
    final notice: my account hold needs to be cleared by the end of
    the day.  I will under no circumstances pay any outstanding charges
    as I have no outstanding debt with the university. The charge
    showing on my account is in error. I am prepared to escalate the
    issue if not resolved by this time tomorrow morning.

    Thank you, 
    Andrew M. James
