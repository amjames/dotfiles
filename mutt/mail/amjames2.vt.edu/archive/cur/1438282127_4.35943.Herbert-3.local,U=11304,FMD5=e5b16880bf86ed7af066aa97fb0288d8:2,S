That all sounds great to me. If you could pick up the car for me, and I =
will get the van on Friday after class that would be awesome. =20

For dropping off on the 3rd/4th:
July 3rd: 4:10 PM is the only departure (2 students)=20

July 4th:
7:30 AM 1 student
12:55 PM 3 students=20
5:12 PM 1 student

Note:There are more going back to the airport than getting picked up =
because we have 3 who are already here for the Software School.=20

I think I can pickup on the 3rd sometime before I have to leave with the =
two students, and return on the 4th after the last trip?=20

Thanks!
