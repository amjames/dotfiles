To whom it may concern,=20

I am the coordinator for the 2015 Summer School for Software Development =
in Computational Chemistry, Bimolecular Simulation and Materials =
Modeling, which will be held at Virginia Tech June 22 - July 1st of this =
year.  While the majority of invited students will be arriving by plane =
we expect some (<20) to drive to campus.  What will I need to do to make =
sure that these students have somewhere to park? How do I go about =
getting them permits in advance of their arrival?=20

Thank you,=20
