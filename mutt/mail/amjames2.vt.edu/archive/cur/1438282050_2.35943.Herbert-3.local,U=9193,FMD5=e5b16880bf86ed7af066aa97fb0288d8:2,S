The school ends after lunch on July 1st. The checkin/checkout day for =
the dorms will be set when we have your travel plans since some students =
will arrive the day before or leave the day after.  I would suggest the =
later flight simply because it gives us the most wiggle room as far as =
getting you to the airport goes.=20
