It has just come to my attention that the dining hall has truncated =
their hours this week.  This is problematic because it appears they =
close dinner at 6:30 PM.  The properties Summer School ends class at =
6:00 PM every day giving the students only a few minutes to eat by the =
time they walk over to D2. Is there anything we can do to fix this?

Thanks,=20
