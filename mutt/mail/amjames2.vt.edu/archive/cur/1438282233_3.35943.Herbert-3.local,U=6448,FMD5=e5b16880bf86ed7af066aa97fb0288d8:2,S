Hello,=20

I am sorry, I completely forgot to mention that part.  Dr. Morris said =
you can just send an email saying you are okay with everything on there =
in place of a signature.  I put email where your signature would go so =
that when I hand the hard copy in to the department they will know why =
it is missing. =20
