Mohammad,

As of right now there is no scheduled time for a poster session or student
talks. I will speak to Dr. Crawford though he is still planing activities
for the evenings and this would be a great time for a poster session I will
let you know and put it up on the website if that is something the
organizers want to do.

Best,
Andrew James
