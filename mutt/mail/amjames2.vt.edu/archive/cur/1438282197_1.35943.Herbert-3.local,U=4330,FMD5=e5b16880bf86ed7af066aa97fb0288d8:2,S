You should be able to find the chemistry specific definitions in your lecture/lab book. I would exercise caution when using dictionary.com or another general dictionary as they may not have the meaning of the word in the context of this course.  However a correct definition from one of those sources is acceptable. Use your best judgement if the definition you find is appropriate for the context of a chemistry lab course.
