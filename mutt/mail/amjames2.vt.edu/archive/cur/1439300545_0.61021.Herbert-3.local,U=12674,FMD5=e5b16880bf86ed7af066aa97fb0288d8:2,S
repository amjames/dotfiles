...That was the cutest thing anyone has ever done for me.  I love you
:-)

Here is my sitch, and we can talk more about it later: 

I got a parking ticket on the mazda back in june. I didnt think they
could link it to my account but they did so whatever. I treid to go in a
pay it but its not on there under the mazda's liscence plate, the jeep's
liscence plate or the new mazda liscene palte (I tried that one for
shits and gigles) The parking people say well there is nothing we can do
you just have to go online and pay it. I told them I can't find it by
the plate number and I dont have the citation number becasue I never got
the ticket ( I threw it away) They said that I could pay it it outright
in the office when the late fees got it up over $400. Unitll then they
can't help me. it would take about 2 years for it to get that high its a
$35 ticket and they add 10$ a month... I can't register for anything
untill  its clear. So I am leaving the school. FUCK THEM ILL GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE
