Good Morning Andrew,

I apologize for the inconvenience but it is standard practice among most 
colleges and universities. As you are a recent graduate, you can request 
that your transcript be mailed to you via the myMarist portal. Please see 
the link below for instructions on how to submit a transcript request. You 
can also submit your request by printing the transcript request form 
located at the bottom of the page and sending it to the Registrar's office 
(the address is located at the bottom of the form). Processing time is 2-3 
business days and transcripts are sent out via USPS.

If you need assistance logging into your account, please contact the help 
desk at (845)575-4357.

Thank you,

I think that is a little silly, but okay then. How do I get a paper copy
so I can scan it?
