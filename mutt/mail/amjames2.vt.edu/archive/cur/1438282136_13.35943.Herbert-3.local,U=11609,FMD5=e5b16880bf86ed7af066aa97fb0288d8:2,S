Hi Laurie,=20

It looks like the smartway bus from VT to the airport will not be =
running on Saturday.  How do you think we should proceed with getting =
everyone back for their flights?=20

It is running normally the rest of the week. However on Wednesday July =
1st Tanmoy Sanyal Has to catch at flight at 5:45 AM.  The earliest bus =
will not even leave squires until after 6:00 AM so I am not sure what we =
should do for him.  If at all possible I would like to avoid missing any =
of the lectures for the Properties Summer School. But If I was to take =
him I might be able togged back to campus on time. Any thoughts?=20
