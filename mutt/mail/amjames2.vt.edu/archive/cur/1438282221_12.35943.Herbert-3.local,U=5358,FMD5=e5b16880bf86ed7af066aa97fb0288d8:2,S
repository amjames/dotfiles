Hi Nick,=20

 YES there is! Well sort of. you want to be using a scientific =
dictionary like the webster dictionary of chemistry is a available as an =
ebook through the library. You can also use the glossary or the actual =
text of any chemistry text. like the one you use for lecture or in some =
cases even the lab manual will have the information you need to define a =
word in the pre-lab reading.

Take care,=20
