Hello Victoria,

Unfortunately no I can't let you update the report after it has been
submitted, but you now know to double check for those things moving
forward. Don't worry that type of thing will only be one point at most.  I
should also let you know that the reference you gave me in the email
wouldn't be a valid source anyway (It isn't  peer reviewed!). n the future
for structures use the pubchem/pubmed or Jmol database, pubchem/pubmed will
have info on smaller molecules while Jmol will have info on proteins and
larger structures!

Take care
