Okay so #3 is a vizio laptop.  I would not recommend going with that for a
few reasons 1 they are a new company so there is not that many reviews out
there about their stuff.  2. being a new company they have a small customer
support department and have read that they are hard to get help from. 3.
The vizio is incredibly thin, which is nice because it is way lighter than
any other 14in screen laptop out there (it only weighs about 3lbs) but,
thin laptops with screen that large tend to over heat very easily making
them fail sooner.

#1-#2 is a hard choice they are both solid machines, I would buy #2.  First
the yoga runs windows RT not the full operating system. That is a major
reason.  The other is the general reviews online are mixed for the yoga
while they are outright positive for the thinkpad.  The thinkpad also comes
with 2 outputs.  One is VGA for older monitors/ projectors for
presentations and stuff.  The other is HDMI which is modern and supports
full HD out.  The think pad is also much more durable and had a better
battery life.  The two are similarly weighted and although they are small
the thinkpad has all of those outputs for you to use with additional
monitors. you also have fast usb ports, sd card reader, and the SSD/HDD
combo so storage is an non issue.  Lenovo is an established company with
great customer support, and very reliable drivers, firmware and online
forums to help you if something goes wrong.

Also unfortunately the computers I can get discounted From my old school
are all above your price range with the discount the lowest one comes to
$1,200 with shipping and tax :(   Let me know if you need anymore help.
