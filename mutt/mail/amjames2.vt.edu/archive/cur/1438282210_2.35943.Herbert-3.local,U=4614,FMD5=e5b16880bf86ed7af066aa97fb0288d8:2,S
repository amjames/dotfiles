From: Controller's Office

Access to the electronic Tax Form Menu within the university Hokie Spa system is temporarily unavailable. This includes access to current and prior year W-2s.

The university proactively disabled access to this information to allow time to review the potential impact of the phishing email that a few Virginia Tech employees received late last week.

At present, no compromises of W-2 data have been detected. The university apologizes for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as the different groups within the university work to ensure the security of the information pertaining to our employees.

We anticipate that access to the Tax Forms Menu and W-2s will be available by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, February 25, 2015.

Remember to ALWAYS be vigilant and think before you click on links included in emails.

More information on the phishing attack can be found at the Virginia Tech Human Resources website under "Crime Alert" notification.

If you have questions please email vtw2@vt.edu.
