Dear Colleagues,

The Brewer Group has a long history of chemistry outreach in our community.
It is a lot of fun and a great opportunity to create new chemists for
future generations of research. As our group members graduate and move away
from Blacksburg, we need increased help from the chemistry graduate student
community to maintain the outreach events.

We have two events for the Kindergarten to College program this Spring. We
will do chemistry demonstrations for a group of students February 27 (this
Friday) and April 10 at 10:45.

Please come and watch the demonstrations so that you will know how to
participate in future outreach events. There will be liquid nitrogen sorbet
as an added incentive.

Please email myself or Dr. Shamindri Arachchige (arachsm@vt.edu) to get
involved.

Thank you.

Hannah Sayre
PhD Candidate
Brewer Research Group
Virginia Tech
