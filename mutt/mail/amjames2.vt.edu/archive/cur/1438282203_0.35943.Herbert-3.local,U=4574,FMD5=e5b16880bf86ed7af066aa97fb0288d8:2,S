To: Chem 1046 TA Group<p/>From: Victoria Long<p/>Not sure how well scholar handled sending my last note. Most of my email contained mostly formatting codes....<br/>
<br/>
Attached is the file for help you with exp. 5 and 6. Please read carefully before you begin TA&#39;ing these next two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We will have a mandatory TA meeting on Tuesday Mar 6 from 6 - 8 pm. I must have all 1046 TAs present, as there are quite a few changes in the labs beginning with experiment 7. There should be no conflicts according to the schedules you provided me. If there is a conflict with an evening exam, please let me know asap.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and hope everyone survived the winter weather!
