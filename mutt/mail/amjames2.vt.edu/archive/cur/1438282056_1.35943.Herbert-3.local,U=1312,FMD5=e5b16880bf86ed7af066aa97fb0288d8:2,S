Hi Taylor,

You know I thought you looked familiar when you came in. Unfortunately
there is not much that we can do here. I can still accept and grade your
post lab for experiment one, but I will have to grade it as late. If you
could Drop that in my mailbox in the CLC (301 HHN) my full name is Andrew
Moulton James that is what should be on my mailbox.  Everything regarding
experiment 2 I suggest you complete on your own, but I can not give you a
grade for that work. You see when you miss lab you automatically get the
minimum grade for the day. That should all be outlined in the syllabus that
you can find on scholar.

I would not worry just try to be on time in the future a few side notes
however.

-You can call me Andrew.
-Please do not put your ID number in any email you send we can identify a
student with their name or with their email on its own, and if I had
replied to your email directly and the ID number was in the quoted text I
would be in violation of FERPA (a set of laws to proceed students privacy)
and could loose my job.
-Don't worry the course is designed to be forgiving for one absence you can
still do fine.
-Please send me a quick email after you drop your post lab in the mailbox,
I may forget to check it otherwise!


Regards,

Andrew James
