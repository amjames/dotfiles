The Virginia Tech community has received an increase in targeted phishing emails. Users are reminded not respond to any email messages requesting your Virginia Tech PID and password.  Anyone who requests this information intends to use it in a malicious manner.

We have received reports of a malicious email targeting VT constituents.  Remember to ALWAYS be vigilant and not click on suspicious links.  This one arrives as an email titled "Inventory Report" and asks you to click on a link to "docu-sign" a shared item.  It appears to install malicious code and in some cases is locking email accounts. 

There is ALSO an email titled "FWD:  Updates to VT's Printed telephone directory" circulating that asks you to update your phone number by logging into Faculty Access/Hokie Spa.  This is a SPAM and not from VT.  DO NOT click on the link.

System updates from direct deposit instruction entered through self-service (hokieSpa, MyVT) have been temporarily suspended.  If you receive an email from "dirdep@vt.edu" titled "Direct Deposit Enrollment" but have not updated your direct deposit instructions, please contact the bursar's office at dirdep@vt.edu or calling (540) 231-6277.  This system generated email is sent immediately when changes are entered in the web portal.
  
Should you have reason to believe that you may have provided your credentials or that they may have been compromised, it is IMPERATIVE you change the password on each of your VT accounts. You can contact 4HELP to assist you in this process.  You should also monitor your accounts, such as HokieSpa or others that use those credentials, for suspicious activity.  Report any suspicious activities to abuse@vt.edu., or call the Virginia Tech Police Department at (540) 231-6411.
