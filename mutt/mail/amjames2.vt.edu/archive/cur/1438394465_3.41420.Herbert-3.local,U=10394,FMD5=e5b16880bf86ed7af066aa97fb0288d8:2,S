Dr. Crawford,

I think I have enough data for us to look at it soon.  Would you like to =
meet this afternoon so I can make up figures, say 2-3PM?=20

Here is an update on my progress:=20
I have a script to plot the NOONs (NO occupation numbers), although they =
are not publication ready figures they should do for looking at the =
results.
I finished a script to make tables of the NOONs with irrep labels last =
night ( Like in Table 3S)=20
I have a script that will let me get the singlet-triplet energy =
comparisons for 4-8 but I only have both states complete for 7=20

I would like to talk with you about some of the other analysis they have =
done before I move forward. I am confused about what they are actually =
doing in some places, and in others I am not sure what I should do for =
comparison. =20

Thanks,
=E2=80=94AJ
