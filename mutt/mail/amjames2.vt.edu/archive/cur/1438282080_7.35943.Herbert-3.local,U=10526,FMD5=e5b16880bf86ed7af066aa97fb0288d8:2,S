Erik,

It is great to hear that you will still be joining us!

To pay the registration fee you can go to this link:

http://www.cpe.vt.edu/reg/pss/pss.pdf

If you are going to pay by credit card you can fax this form to the number =
on the right hand side, or mail it to the address given.  If you plan to pa=
y by any other method you can call the phone number on the right hand side =
above the fax number to speak to someone in the office. I believe they can =
process some kinds of payment over the phone as well. They will have the be=
st information on how to get your payment thorough.

You can ignore the date on the form it is incorrect and your payment should=
 still be accepted. If you have any trouble please let me know!

Regards,
Andrew M James
Summer School Coordinator

My supervisor will pay the fee and has a Swedish bank account. How can we s=
