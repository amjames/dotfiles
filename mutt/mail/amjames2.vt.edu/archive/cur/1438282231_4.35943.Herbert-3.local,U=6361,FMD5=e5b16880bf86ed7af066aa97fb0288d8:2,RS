Dear Dr. Troya,=20

I am Andrew James (AJ) a first year student for Dr. Crawford.  I am =
writing in hopes that you would be willing to be a member of my advisory =
committee.  If you are, I have attached a copy of my proposed Plan of =
Study. If you are okay with everything on there I can come by at your =
earliest connivence to have you sign it, or if you would like to set up =
a meeting first to talk with me. =20
Thanks,
=E2=80=94AJ=20=
