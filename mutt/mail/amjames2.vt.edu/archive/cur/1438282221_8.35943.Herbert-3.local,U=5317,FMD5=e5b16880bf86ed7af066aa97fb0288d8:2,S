Hi Mrs. Dalton,=20

Ramaan emailed me last week (on wed. morning)  to ask if he could do the =
pre lab quiz and come to lab even though it was late. I told him sorry, =
but no it was due at 9PM and to make sure he got this week=E2=80=99s =
done on time.  My grade book software pulls the quizzes automatically at =
9:30PM, Tuesday night for my Wednesday section, so I didn=E2=80=99t =
actually look at who had finished it personally until you sent me this =
message. Should I send him an email to see whats up?=20

=E2=80=94AJ=20
