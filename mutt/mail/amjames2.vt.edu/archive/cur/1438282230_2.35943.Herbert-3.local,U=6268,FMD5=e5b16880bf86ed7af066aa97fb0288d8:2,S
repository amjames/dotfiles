A few suggestions:
1. You are missing the abstract
2. In the introduction you say that AA is one of the methods used to =
reduce the contamination in waste water. that is not true AA is used to =
measure the contamination.  You also need to go into more detail about =
how and why the contaminants become present in the waster. And the =
chemistry that goes on in the water to remove the toxic metals
3. In the procedure don=E2=80=99t list the ph of the samples like that =
put things in paragraph form or a table if that would be better suited.=20=

4. The calibration curve data should be fit with a linear trend remember =
beers law, the concentration has a direct linear relationship to =
absorbance. Even if an exponential gives a better R squared value it is =
physically incorrect and we know that from our studies of chemistry=20
5. That also means that your calculations would need to be redone.
6. In your tables you have collumns labeled PPM, ppm is a unit (and it =
should be lower case) so the column title should be something like [Cu] =
(ppm). Saying ppm on its own doesn=E2=80=99t mean anything we need to =
know concentration of what.=20
7. Reference 1 is not peer review and therefore not appropriate for a =
scientific paper.=20
8. Conclusions should come before the post lab questions. =20

besides these few things it looks pretty good, See you on Thursday.=20
