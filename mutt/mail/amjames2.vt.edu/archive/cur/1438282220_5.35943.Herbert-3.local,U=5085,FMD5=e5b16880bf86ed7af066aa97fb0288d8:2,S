Hi Daniel,

I can't find any need for corrections/improvements. Looks very =
professional, now we just have to live up to this great presentation of =
things. :-)

Regarding participation from my CoTXS network, I would like to reserve 7 =
seats for the Swedish delegation. I will ask them to register via the =
homepage once the e-mail has been sent out.

Best wishes,
Patrick.
