Outstanding, Justin!  Thanks to you and all the ARC staff for your help and
support.

I plan to be at the classroom in Goodwin by about 8:30 to make sure things
are in place.  I'll give a few minutes' introduction to the overall school
and then turn things over to our Software Carpentry colleagues, Tommy and
Daniel (copied).
