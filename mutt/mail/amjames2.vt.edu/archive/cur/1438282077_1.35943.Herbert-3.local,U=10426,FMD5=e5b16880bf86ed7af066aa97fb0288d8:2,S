Dear Justin,

Thanks for the additional accounts.  There is no problem with using a
blanket password, as there's nothing to protect.  Also, I think it best if
I just give the instructors access to one of my servers so they can access
the guest accounts more easily, including from off-campus.

Can I get access to a few (4) of the hpcXX accounts right away so the
external instructors can test the environment?

Thanks very much!

-TDC

P.S. AJ, can you ask Harley to create four accounts on sirius for Robert
Harrison, Eugene DePrince, Tommy Guy, and Daniel Chen to use for access to
blueridge from off campus?  I think Robert may already have one.
