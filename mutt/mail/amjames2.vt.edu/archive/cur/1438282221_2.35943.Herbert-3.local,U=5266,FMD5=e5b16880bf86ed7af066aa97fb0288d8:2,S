Hi Miranda,=20

The experimental yield is a percentage, often referred to as a percent =
yield. Using the stoichometry of the reaction and the masses (converted =
to moles) of the starting reagents you can calculate how much product =
you can get as a theoretical maximum. Then using the mass of your =
actually final product you can calculate the percentage by mass or moles =
of that theoretical maximum you obtained.=20

Hope this helps!=20
