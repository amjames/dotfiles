AJ,

Here's some information to help with the website setup:

(1) Broad agenda:

Days 1 & 2: The Software Carpentry team will cover fundamentals software
tools such as git, Python, Makefiles, and more.

Days 3 & 4: Prof. Edward Valeev will give an overview of modern
high-performance computing architectures and the basics of code
optimization.

Days 4 & 5: Prof. Daniel Crawford will introduce numerical libraries such
as BLAS and LAPACK, as well as interactive debugging methods.

Students will have opportunities for hiking and other social events over
the weekend...

Days 6 & 7: Prof. Robert Harrison will cover parallel computing =E2=80=93 b=
oth
shared- and distributed-memory architectures =E2=80=93 and software develop=
ment for
such environments.

Day 8: Prof. Eugene DePrince will introduce students to code techniques to
take advantage of graphical-processing units (GPUs).


(2) For the blurb on each instructor, mention their affiliation and touch
on what they'll cover at the school.  I may decide we should add more later=
.

(3) For the student information, indicate that all students accepted to the
school we have their room and board covered.  They will only need to
provide their transportation to and from the Virginia Tech campus.  More
details to be provided later.

I probably need to work with the registration folks to make sure that we
have a means for the students to provide a CV and a brief description of
their research and its need for software development.

-TDC
