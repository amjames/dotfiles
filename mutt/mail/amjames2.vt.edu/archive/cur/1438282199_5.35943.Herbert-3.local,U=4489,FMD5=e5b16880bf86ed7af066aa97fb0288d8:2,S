Good afternoon all - I'm getting many students say that the virtlab is not =
opening exp. 3.2 for this weeks lab. Please make sure you re-register using=
 the new activation code: VTS524. This is a different code than used last s=
emester. I think you can also click on the link =93Upgrade to Full Virtlab=
=94 and then go through a few screens and then use the new code. In all cas=
es this has fixed the problem. Thanks, Victoria Long

Please see the checklist I sent last week with more detailed directions to =
register for virtlab if needed.
