Hi Andrew,

I made my original travel plans based on the information I received  
that the last day of the summer school would end early. But also, the  
confirmation email I received from confreg@vt.edu stated that lodging  
checkout would be July 1, so leaving July 2 did not even seem like an  
option.

I am very interested in DePrince's GPU lectures, so I have changed my  
flight. I will now depart Roanoke on Thursday July 2 at 5:45 AM on US  
Airways Flight 4776.

I have incurred a $291.00 fee to change my flight due to the  
misinformation. Is there any possibility that this could be reimbursed  
by the summer school?

Thank you,

John
