Dear Daniel,

I am back in Lubbock and followed Anita's and your comments. I think the 
agreement in the H.F. calculations is resolved. I expect that the NO 
occupations according to Pulay will also agree. The next question is how 
does the new UHF wavefunction affect the CCSD results. I imagine that 
one should compute a total density matrix from the CCSD wavefunction as 
well. Don't you think?
What kind of NO occupations and NOs did you use first? These were in the 
set of alpha and beta spin orbitals. The space parts are not orthogonal 
to each other. Thus, they are difficult to interpret. The advantage of 
diagonalizing the total spin density matrix is that the resulting NOs 
refer to the same basis. This question is more involved than I thought.

Best regards, Hans

    Dear Daniel,<br>
    <br>
    I am back in Lubbock and followed Anita's and your comments. I think
    the agreement in the H.F. calculations is resolved. I expect that
    the NO occupations according to Pulay will also agree. The next
    question is how does the new UHF wavefunction affect the CCSD
    results. I imagine that one should compute a total density matrix
    from the CCSD wavefunction as well. Don't you think?<br>
    What kind of NO occupations and NOs did you use first? These were in
    the set of alpha and beta spin orbitals. The space parts are not
    orthogonal to each other. Thus, they are difficult to interpret. The
    advantage of diagonalizing the total spin density matrix is that the
    resulting NOs refer to the same basis. This question is more
    involved than I thought.<br>
    <br>
    Best regards, Hans<br>

                                  <div>Thank you to Anita for the
                                    additional information.  Our triplet
                                    instabilities appear to match, at
                                    least as far as our B3LYP
                                    functionals match.  (I believe
                                    you're using a slightly different
                                    VWN functional in Turbomole than we
                                    are; we use the G09 "definition" by
                                    default.  Our total energies match
                                    to a couple of decimal
                                    places: -1069.66334405 E_h (ours)
                                    vs. -1069.6608882 (yours), again
                                    differences likely attributable to
                                    the definition of the functional.
                                     (I also tested our code vs. G09 for
                                    this case, and we get a match out to
                                    six decimal places.)  After
                                    following the Ag triplet
                                    instability, we optimize to a proper
                                    UHF wave function with
                                    energy -1069.71414813 E_h vs.
                                    your is  -1069.711505 E_h.  Again, I
                                    consider this a reasonable
                                    comparison in this case.</div>

                                  <div>I have a few responses to your
                                    message below and Anita's document:</div>

                                  <div>(1) Our code follows MO Hessian
                                    eigenvectors within the totally
                                    symmetric irrep by default in order
                                    to maintain the symmetry of the
                                    orbitals, even if the corresponding
                                    eigenvalue is not the most
                                    negative.  It is not unusual to
                                    obtain a local minimum on the
                                    Hartree-Fock orbital rotation
                                    surface after following such an
                                    eigenvector, but, as your
                                    calculations indicate, we haven't
                                    found the global minimum.</div>

                                  <div>(2) Responding to some of Anita's
                                    comments in the Word document, I
                                    should note that following an
                                    eigenvector of the MO Hessian
                                    affects *all* orbitals, not just
                                    those of a particular irrep.  The
                                    eigenvector irrep refers to the
                                    direct product of the component
                                    rotation orbitals, U_ai, where a and
                                    i are virtual and occupied orbitals
                                    in the original basis.  Thus, an Ag
                                    eigenvector involves mixings between
                                    all orbital pairs where the direct
                                    product is Ag, so that includes
                                    Au*Au, Bu*Bu, etc.  Furthermore,
                                    since these are triplet
                                    instabilities of an RHF reference,
                                    the Ag eigenvector will not destroy
                                    the spatial symmetry of the orbitals
                                    (i.e. they all still transform as
                                    irreps of C2h) but it will destroy
                                    only their spin symmetry.  I
                                    apologize for the elaboration if all
                                    this was already clear.</div>
                                  <div><br>
                                  </div>
                                  <div>(3) I'm re-running our
                                    calculations forcing Cs symmetry in
                                    order to push the Bu MO Hessian
                                    eigenvector into the totally
                                    symmetric irrep.  That will allow us
                                    to make a proper comparison of our
                                    UHF-CCSD wave function natural
                                    orbitals using the same MO basis
                                    that you have for the MRAQCC
                                    calculations.  I should be able to
                                    report back relatively soon.</div>

                                                I am attaching the
                                                analysis of zethrene
                                                which Anita sent me.
                                                Currently, I am in
                                                Vienna and have only
                                                e-mail contact. I added
                                                some comments to her
                                                text. It is written with
                                                Track Changes, mainly
                                                for her information.<br>
                                                It seems to me that
                                                polarizing the Ag
                                                orbitals we get
                                                practically the same
                                                results as you, as much
                                                as I could see form the
                                                orbital energies.
                                                However, it would be
                                                good to know also your
                                                total energies and to
                                                compare the shape of the
                                                HOMO and LUMO.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                From the first stability
                                                analysis one would say
                                                that also the orbitals

                                                          should be
                                                          correct.
