Dear Students,

Because of the holiday on Monday, CHEM 6434 Organometallic Chemistry 
will start on Wed Jan 21 at 9:05 AM in HHN 402.  If you plan to take 
this course, please register for it on Hokie Spa so that you can be 
added to the Scholar site.  All further messages about the course will 
be distributed from Scholar.

The textbook will be "The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition 
Metals" by Robert Crabtree.  The book is in a new (sixth) edition as of 
last year.  I will be compelled to buy myself a copy.  I am not aware 
that the book is available at the campus bookstore, because I never 
placed the order.  But you can easily buy it online (e.g., from 
Amazon).  As usual, you can hunt around for an inexpensive previous 
edition on the used market, but there is always a risk that there will 
be information in the new edition that you'll miss.  My guess is that 
the level of risk is relatively low with the fifth edition, but honestly 
I haven't seen the sixth edition yet (I have to order it too!) so I 
really don't know.  Furthermore, I intend to start the course with a 
couple of lectures summarizing some of the most important fundamental 
principles of inorganic chemistry that will be applied throughout the 
course, and then I will spend a few lectures discussing main-group 
organometallic chemistry.  Since Crabtree doesn't cover main-group 
elements, that means you will not really need the textbook until well 
into the second week of classes.

Let me know if you have questions.  A syllabus will be posted in the 
next day or so.
