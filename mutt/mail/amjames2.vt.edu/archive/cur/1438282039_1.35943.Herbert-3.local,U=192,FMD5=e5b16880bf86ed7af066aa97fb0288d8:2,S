Sorry to bother you while your away, but I'm having issues submitting
gaussian jobs to the que.  I have traced the problem to a bash script that
you need to source to set up g09 correctly so I was wondering if you could
change my shell back to tcsh permanently for me? when I change the shell
and source a copy of your .cshrc the jobs submit fine. But it would be a
pain have to change the shell every time I submit.

Thanks
-AJ
