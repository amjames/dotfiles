Hi Javier,=20

I got psi4 complied on cerebro and you should be able to access my =
executable.  You can add it to your path it is in:
/cerebro/home/crawdad/ajay/bin

If you don=E2=80=99t already have one I stuck an example psi4 input in
/cerebro/home/crawdad/ajay/people/javier

Harley has quite a few more examples than that if you are looking for =
them you should be able to find them in his home directory.=20
If you still want to get a copy compiled on your laptop we can take a =
swing at it sometime too. Just let me know if you need anything else!
