Hi Lori,=20

I am just about finished with #117 and I wanted to ask what I should do =
to add the code.  I use github for my own personal stuff a lot but I =
have never made a commit to a repo that has other people contributing to =
it and I don=E2=80=99t want to make a mess :)

 I also had one question about the handling of the old r/u/ro hf/scf =
calls. Would you like these to be caught specially or just handled as if =
any invalid argument had been given to energy/gradient/property (i.e. =
did you mean =E2=80=A6 ?)=20

Thanks for the help!
