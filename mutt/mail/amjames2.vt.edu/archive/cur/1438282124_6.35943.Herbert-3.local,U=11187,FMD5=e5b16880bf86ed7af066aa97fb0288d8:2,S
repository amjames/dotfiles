I went ahead and turned this one off on both public and private (if you
want to overrule me, that's okay with me and I'll turn it back on), but
I share the sentiment that we should have as many add-ons on as
possible.  I don't share your sentiment about failing at configure time
being acceptable under normal circumstances.  I think configure should
be designed to succeed as often as possible because to the average user,
who barely understands compilation, such failures make our code look
shoddy.  The caveat to that being I'm okay with configure failing for
glaringly obvious dependencies missing, like BLAS.  In this particular
case I've found that HDF5 is installed on less than half of the machines
I've tried, so the configure fails more often than it succeeds, which
I'm not okay with.
