John,=20

Students will be able to stay the night of July 1st and many have chosen =
flights that leave the next day. The lecture will end by 6PM so leaving =
enough time to get you to the airport a flight leaving after 8 PM that =
night would make sure you can stay for the whole lecture.  We are also =
planning a farewell dinner that may be the last night of the program, =
but since many students are leaving that day we might have that the =
night before so everyone can attend. =20

If you are able to change your flight just let me know of the changes so =
I can make the appropriate arguments.=20

Sorry again for my mistake,=20
