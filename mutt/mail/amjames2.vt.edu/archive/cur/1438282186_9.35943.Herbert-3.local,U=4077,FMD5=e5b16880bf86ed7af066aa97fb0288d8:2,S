Hello Kristina, 

I was hoping that you could add me too the scholar site for the Journal Club.  I would love to join. I would have last semester, but I am a first year and we had the Chem 5004 meetings after Highlands every Friday. 

Thanks,

This club is run and attended by graduate students and postdocs from our department and provides a great forum to discuss current published research.  It is great practice to talk science, explore research, learn techniques not directly in your field, and to discover something new.

If you cannot make the first meeting but are still interested in attending a meeting, the journal articles being discussed will be posted on our Scholar site.  Please send me an email and I will add you to the site.
