AJ,

1) a) Molecular Response Properties Summer School
b) June 29-July 3
c) OK for now.

2) The arrangements are the same in that students will stay in the dorms
and have on-campus meal plans.  However, there will be a set fee that I can
tell you after the registration link is in place ($500-something).

3) I *think* I've given you access to the site
http://theory.chem.vt.edu/response.  To get to it, you must use a WebDAV
client (Dreamweaver, for example) and point it to:

https://webdav.hosting.vt.edu/www.theory.chem.vt.edu/response

You can try to login to hosting.vt.edu directly using your VT pid and
password, plus the site name:

www.theory.chem.vt.edu/response

Let me know if it works!

-TDC
