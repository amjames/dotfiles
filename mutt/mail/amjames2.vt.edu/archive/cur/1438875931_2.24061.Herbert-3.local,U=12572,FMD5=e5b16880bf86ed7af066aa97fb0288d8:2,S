Dr. Crawford, 

    Thanks for your help! 

    I will add this to the UHF code, and get the UHF_NO's back to you for
    comparison ASAP.  I can't work out why this only works for the total
    density, is it that there are no alpha and beta natural
    orbitals in this definition? I also don't see where eq. 3 comes from why 
    are the natural orbitals found by diagonalizing S(1/2)D S(1/2), and
    not just D? If we could discuss those details (at some point) 
    that would be very helpful.

    Also I have no idea why but, I never looked at my results for the
    total density I only computed S(1/2)Da/bS(1/2) and since those
    results didn't look right I never tried the full density.  

    Thanks again, 
    --AJ
