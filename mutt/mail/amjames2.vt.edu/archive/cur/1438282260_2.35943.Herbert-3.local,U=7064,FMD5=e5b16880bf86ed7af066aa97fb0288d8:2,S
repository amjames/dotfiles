Dear Andrew,

Please find my CV enclosed. And I checked the visa application process, and
while I couldn't find the request for a latter (maybe it will come later in
the process, or maybe this is not necessary under the Visa Waiver
Program?), I need a contact point in the US. Can I use you or someone else
for this, and what address, e-mail, and phone number should I use then?

Best regards,
Thomas
