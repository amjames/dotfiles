AJ:  I have an 11-passenger van reserved - but just one.  I didn't think 2 =
would be needed - but I can get one just in case? That van will need to be =
picked up Friday afternoon - this one is in your name.
I think somebody's car would be fine too.  I can help with pickup. (Unfortu=
nately, the Smartways Bus does not run on Sunday.)
You've made a spreadsheet of arrivals, correct?  Maybe we should go over th=
at together (perhaps with Harley too) to get some kind of definite departur=
e times from ROA.
Some may have to wait to be picked up, but if we had two vehicles going bac=
k and forth (again, if needed), people would only have to wait for an hour =
at most.
Jessica, I believe, will be on site to help with check-in (will you J?)
I think you've done a wonderful job, AJ!
Laurie

P.S.  Daniel:  I do NOT have any vans reserved for a trip to Franks CineBow=
l (FCB) for a mid-week event or closing night event (I.e., June 30).  If we=
 pursue this - and I'll make calls and find out options - what nightl?
If we DO do June 30 - we could theoretically combine groups into one event.=
 Just a thought - haven't pursued it with FCB to see if a group of 60+ is e=
ven possible.
I will need to get vans reserved for this if we do it.
