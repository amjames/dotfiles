Hi, all,

I'm sorry I've been invisible so much recently, but I am happy to report
that I submitted the proposal at 4:44pm today =E2=80=93 a full 16 minutes b=
efore
the deadline!

Now that the task is done, I would like to meet with you all as a group
tomorrow morning.  Is it possible to get together in the lab at 9:00? I
know that this is short notice, but I need to fulfill family obligations in
Maryland for a couple of days, but I'd rather not do so without
re-connecting with y'all.

-TDC
