Andrew,

A police officer came to our apartment shortly after I sent you that last
email and my roommate was admitted to a suicide prevention center for two
days. I know calling the police was probably protocol, but I would have
appreciated a response to my previous email. Would it be possible for me to
makeup the second lab? Also, what lab is bench C doing this week?

Thank you,

Ramaan Insari
