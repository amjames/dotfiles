Hello,=20

I am drafting updates to the website for the SSS right now, and I wanted =
to put  some arrival info on there as well. I am missing/unsure of some =
of those details.=20

Such as:
	Where is everyone supposed to check in?=20
	What would they need to have with them?=20
	Anything you would want them to know?=20
	Do they need their own bed-sheets?=20
	Do the rooms have A/C (=10should they bring fans)?=20

I am embedding a land-marked map of campus, so I have marked Goodwin, =
D2, and the Perry St. Garage (for those driving). I would like add the =
building they will be staying in, and the one where check in is. Do you =
think I should include anything else?=20


Folks flying in are starting to email me looking for details on how/when =
they will be picked up. Do we have a planned schedule of van trips? =
Should I make one up ( if so how big are the vans?).=20

If you think there is anything else I should include let me know (I am =
afraid of forgetting something).=20

Thanks
