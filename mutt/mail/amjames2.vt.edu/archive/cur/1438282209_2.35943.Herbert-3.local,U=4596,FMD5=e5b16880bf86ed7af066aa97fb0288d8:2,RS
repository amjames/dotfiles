Hello Andrew,
     I am in your Thursday Chem 1046 lab and I have been trying to
understand the instructions for the virtual lab due. However the
instructions in the manual and the ones online are two different ideas. I
do not understand how the data is suppose to be collected. I checked the
online power point and it did not help any either. If you have any ideas as
to how to remedy this please let me know.

Thanks so much,
--
