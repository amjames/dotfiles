Andrew,

The other student (Daniel Nascimento) will be arriving at 3:40PM as we had =
originally intended. I had to choose a flight that gets to ROA earlier beca=
use there were no seats left on the other flight.

Daniel will e-mail you his itinerary separately, but his flight is schedule=
d to land at 3:40PM.

Daniel and I are on the same itinerary on our return to Tallahassee.

Thank you.

Elvis
