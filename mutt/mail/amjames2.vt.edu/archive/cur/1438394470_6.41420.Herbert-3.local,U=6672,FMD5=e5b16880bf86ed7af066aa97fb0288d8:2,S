Thanks, Hans!  We're going to follow the same active space structure Anita
has in her computations.

    Dear Daniel,<br>
    <br>
    It is good to hear about your progress.<br>
    Our procedure concerning the active orbitals for the CASSCF is a
    pragmatic one. First of all, the CASSCF calculation does not stand
    alone, it is only meant to provide appropriate orbitals for the
    subsequent MRCI and MR-AQCC calculations. The CAS space increases
    exponentially and very soon gets out of hand. At the MRCI and
    MR-AQCC all orbitals not frozen are correlated, with the AQCC
    calculation even higher (quadruple) excitations included explicitly.
    Thus, our focus is more on the construction of the reference space
    for MR-AQCC than having an extensive CASSCF space. For the choice of
    the reference space NO occupations of test AQCC calculations and the
    analysis of the major contributions to the wavefunction were used.=C2=
=A0
    We have a occupation threshold of ~0.05-0.1 e. Orbitals for which
    the NO occupation deviates=C2=A0 from 2 and 0, respectively,=C2=A0 more=
 than
    that are included into the active space. Anita also looked at DFT
    orbital energies, to my knowledge.=C2=A0 She can give more information
    when needed. Another point was that the non-Kekule systems have D3h
    symmetry and we can use only C2v. Thus, we do not have good control
    over degenerate orbitals. Thus, sometimes a bit of experimenting was
    necessary in order to balance the choice of orbitals and not to let
    one degenerate component in the active space and the other one in
    the virtual space.<br>
    <br>
    The size of 7 orbitals is certainly not a hard limit, it was chosen
    out of convenience. I am even not sure at the moment whether all
    cases calculated have the same CAS size at CASSCF level. As I said
    before, it is more the choice of the reference space for the AQCC
    calculation which is important for us.<br>
    <br>
    Please let me know whether you have more questions.<br>
    <br>
