To: Chem 1046 TA Group<p/>From: Victoria Long<p/>Good morning all - just a quick reminder that we have a mandatory TA meeting tomorrow evening from 6 to 8 *Tuesday March 3). Please bring your manuals and computers - again <strong>BRING YOUR MANUALS AND COMPUTERS! </strong>We are moving to online quizzes rather than prelab reports for exp. 7-12, so I need you to take the online quizzes during the meeting tomorrow so we can verify everything is working correctly, and anticipate any potential problems. Good news for you - no prelabs to grade! So we&#39;ll see you tomorrow evening. I do expect to take the full 2 hr, so please eat prior to the meeting. Thanks, Vicki Long<p>----------------------<br>This forwarded message was sent via Scholar Messages from the  "Gen Chem TA Site S15" site.
