Thanks for the email reminder! I checked with my records and it would =
appear a user error occurred on my end, with the keyboard. The technical =
term would be I =E2=80=9Cfat fingered=E2=80=9D  then num-pad and hit 5 =
instead of 8.  I have updated the grade book, please check tomorrow to =
verify the update on your end!=20

See you in lab=20
