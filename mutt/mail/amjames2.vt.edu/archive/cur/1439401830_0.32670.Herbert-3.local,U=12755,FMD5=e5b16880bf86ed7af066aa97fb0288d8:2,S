Hey AJ,

That's awesome to hear you will be at SETCA! It would be awesome if I  
could go in the Spring. I'll keep you posted.

I'm an upcoming Senior now. I just finished my summer (REU program) at  
A&M working for Steven Wheeler (I'm sure you've met him or at least of  
him from Fritz). He did his PhD at Georgia after Johnny. He is a  
computational organic chemist, and I absolutely loved working for him.  
I now want to go to graduate school for computational organic  
chemistry! I'm particularly looking at UC Davis (Tantillo) and UCLA  
(Houk) to be closer to family. But A&M is not entirely off my radar.

Who are you collaborating with at A&M? It's a big and interesting  
department. It's awesome to catch up with you man. We should  
definitely keep in touch.

All the best,

Croix
