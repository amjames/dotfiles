Dr. Crawford,
First, I hope you were able to get away to PR with your family safely =
after yesterday=E2=80=99s weather. The website for the software school =
is pretty much complete. I have highlighted the last changes to each =
page in the list below, and put some final questions in there as well.  =
The link again so you don=E2=80=99t have go looking for it.=20

(1) The homepage: I changed around the presenters (now instructors) =
section. I added pictures of each and their affiliations. And the topic =
they will talk about. Each name is a link to that persons faculty page =
and once we know who will be coming from software carpentry for certain =
I can expand that into two separate blocks with their own pictures
	In the interested students section of the home page:
            -Do those requirements look good?=20
            -Where should the documents be sent?=20
            -What should the deadline be?

(2) The agenda page:I have put videos/slides Here in the individual =
panels rather than the front page. I don=E2=80=99t entirely love how the =
side panel looks, and it isn=E2=80=99t really nesesary at this point =
should I move the videos and slides here?  Should I mention that there =
will be an activity the first night to meet the other students?=20

(3) The Student page: I put a map in showing Blacksburg and Roanoke with =
a VT icon and a airplane Icon showing the location of the airport and =
campus (that was a lot of fun).

(4)Miscellaneous details and questions.
 	-Is the funding information is correct?=20
	-What should I put as the copyright I have put SCIM^2
	-What should be listed as the contact info in the footer of each =
page?
        -As things are updated I can put a badge next to that heading =
that says new! or something to that effect, an example is in the first =
entry on the students page=20

(5)Registration: I think I just need the link and it is good to go!


Moving to the properties school: I plan on using the same site just =
swapping the text like we discussed. I think that will be ready to go =
very quickly. I can put it where ever it needs to go I have the site on =
my laptop right now with all of the details left blank I would just need =
to fill it in. If you would like them to look slightly different I can =
change out the picture and change the orange color to match that picture =
(not very difficult the way I have modified the template)=20

=E2=80=94AJ=20

PS sorry this is a bit lengthy, but I wanted to make sure we got it all =
wrapped up!=20
