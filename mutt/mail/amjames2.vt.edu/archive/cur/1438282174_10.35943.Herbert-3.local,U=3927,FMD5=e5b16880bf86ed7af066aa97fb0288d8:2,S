Dear Dr. Crawford,=C2=A0


I am starting to write up the results I have collected for those MD =
simulations. I wanted to give you a quick update of where I am at, and also=
 ask you a few questions:
-I have solid results for methylthiirane and methyloxirane ( I believe we =
already discussed this). I saved all of the results and output, and =
resubmitted them because I had sightly different parameters for the MD =
simulations. I don=E2=80=99t suspect the results will be very different, =
but I wanted to make sure all of the jobs were uniform. =C2=A0
I am still waiting on the results for norborenone, but based on my shorter =
test simulations I don=E2=80=99t foresee anymore holdups.=C2=A0
I would like to put together some tables comparing the results from these =
simulations to experiment and some other =C2=A0computational studies. =
=C2=A0I can search the literature to find numbers for comparison, but I =
wanted to ask if you had particular data that you would like me to compare =
to (i.e. data that you have compared to previously). =C2=A0


I hope you had an enjoyable christmas.=C2=A0
