Hello Jessica,=20

It was brought to my attention that the Software Summer School =
Registration is closed already.  We need the registration page to be =
open still as we are sending acceptance letters to some last minute =
applicants . The application deadline was May 31 and it looks like the =
registration ended before that even on the 30th. Is there a way we can =
get that opened back up?=20

Thanks,=20
