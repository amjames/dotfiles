Hi Laurie,=20

Javier mentioned that he had a small problem accessing his dorm using =
the Hokie passport.  Are you able to check, or do you know who could =
check that it is working okay for him now? The building was unlocked the =
last time he entered. Is he able to get his card to unlock the door to =
Davidson also? I would hate for him to get stuck out in one of these =
storms rolling through!=20

Thanks,
--AJ=
