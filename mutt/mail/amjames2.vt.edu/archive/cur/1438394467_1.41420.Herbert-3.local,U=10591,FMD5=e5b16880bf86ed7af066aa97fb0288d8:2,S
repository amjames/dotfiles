Hello Dr. Crawford,=20

Some updates on various things:

Polyradicals:
I am re-running the calculations for 4 and 7 using a UHF reference as =
they suggested to see if the discrepancy in open shell character of the =
singlet is resolved.=20
Do you think I should carry out all of the calculations using a UHF =
reference?=20
I am still a bit confused about the =E2=80=9Cextended=E2=80=9D and =
=E2=80=9Caugmented pi-space + selected sigma orbitals=E2=80=9D freezing =
schemes.=20
I am making tables (like they have in the supplemental information) to =
explain the reduced active spaces I have used so far, and maybe their =
comments on those tables will help?=20
Software School:
I was able to login to blue ridge using hpc0-4 and the password =
=E2=80=9Chokies14=E2=80=9D(from the lab)=20
The external instructors all have sirius accounts:
Eugene DePrince: dprince
Daniel Chen: dcheny=20
Tommy Guy: tguy
Robert Harrison: rjharrison *
the passwords are the same as the usernames, but Dr. Harrison already =
had an account so I do not know what his password is. If he needs it =
reset I can do that.=20
I am still working on the leaflet I should have something to send to =
you/Laurie Tomorrow morning (at the latest).
I will send you the website pages that are being added/updated. =20
Should I leave the starting times for social/weekend activities as TBA =
for now?

Is there anything I should have mentioned that I have forgotten?=20

Thanks, and hope you are enjoying your trip.
