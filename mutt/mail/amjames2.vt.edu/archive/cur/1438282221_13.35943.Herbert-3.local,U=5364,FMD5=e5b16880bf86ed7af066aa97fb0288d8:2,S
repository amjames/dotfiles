Hi,=20

I I found your post lab and I now know why I never printed it out!  My =
mac is a little weird and without getting into too many specifics I =
can=E2=80=99t actually open Microsoft docx=E2=80=99s or .doc=E2=80=99s. =
Could you please save this as a pdf and email it to me again? If you =
can=E2=80=99t then just print it out yourself and bring it in next week! =
Thanks=20
