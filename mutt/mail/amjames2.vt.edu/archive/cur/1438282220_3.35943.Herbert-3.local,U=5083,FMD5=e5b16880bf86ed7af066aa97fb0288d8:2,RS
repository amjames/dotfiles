A reminder:

We will be giving our second General Chemistry 1036 test tonight Tuesday
March 17 at 7:00-8:30 pm.

If you proctor for me in Davidson Hall or in Surge or for Dr. Durrill in
Goodwin Hall, you will proctor on this evening.
If you proctor in Davidson 281: please arrive in that room at 6:40 pm.

If you proctor in Surge 104A, 104B, 104C please meet Dr. Arachchige in
Surge 117 at 6:40 pm (she is helping me with my test).

If you proctor for  Dr. Durrill in Goodwin Hall, meet him on the ground
floor of Goodwin Hall near Room 190 at 6:30 pm.


We are counting on all of you showing up - should you have a conflict, you
must find a substitute and let me know who that is.

Thank you for your help.
