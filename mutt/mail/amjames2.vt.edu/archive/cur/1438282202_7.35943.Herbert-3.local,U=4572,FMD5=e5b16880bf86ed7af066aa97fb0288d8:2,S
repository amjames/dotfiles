Dear Colleagues,

As you know, earlier this month, Dr. McNamee announced his plans to step down from his position as the university's chief academic officer.  Now, we are faced with the challenging task of finding the next Executive Vice President and Provost.  This position has a leadership role in each of the three missions of the university and affects each and every student and faculty member, current and future.  Ideally, the search will be brought to a successful conclusion by the end of the spring semester, but the importance of finding the best person to fill the position eclipses the timeline, so we should be prepared that the search may continue into the early part of the fall semester.  We are fortunate that Dr. McNamee is willing to continue to serve until his successor assumes the position.  

Search Committee - We are serving as co-chairs of the search committee, which is comprised of faculty, staff, and student representation from across the university.   We have endeavored to be very inclusive in forming the committee, with most members representing more than one constituent group.  The committee includes:

Dr. Markus Breitschmid                              Dr. Ben Knapp
Dr. Cyril Clarke                                                Mr. Austin Larrowe
Dr. Rafael Davalos                                         Dr. Nancy McGehee
Dr. Karen DePauw                                         Dr. Saied Mostaghimi
Dr. Srinath Ekkad                                           Dr. Patty Perillo
Dr. Jack Finney                                               Dr. Patty Raun
Ms. Ashley Francis                                        Ms. Kimberly Rhodes
Dr. Bernice Hausman                                   Dr. Karen Eley Sanders
Dr. Edwin Jones                                             Dr. John Seiler
Dr. Russell Jones                                           Mr. Dwight Shelton
Dr. Sallie Keller                                               Dr. Tyler Walters

Kim O'Rourke and Cheryl Peterson from the President's Office are staffing the committee.

Your input is invited - We are very interested in learning your thoughts about the ideal candidate and the qualities and qualifications that the next Executive Vice President and Provost should possess.  Keeping in mind the aggressive timeline, we felt it important to begin this process before spring break.  To that end, we are planning to hold two town-hall meetings next week that are open to the university community, and each member of the search committee subsequently will also be gathering information from their respective constituencies.  We ask that supervisors try to accommodate employees who wish to attend whenever possible.

Two town-hall meetings will be held on Wednesday, February 25, in the Haymarket Theatre in Squires Student Center at the following times:  
                                                                           12:00-1:30 p.m.
                                                                             3:30-5:00 p.m.
An audio recording will be made of each town-hall meeting and posted to the search web site so that those who cannot attend the meetings can hear the discussion.

Communicating with the Search Committee - Throughout the search, you are welcome to send your thoughts and questions to the search committee via email to provostsearch@vt.edu.

Search website - A website is being created to enable the university community, potential candidates, and members of the public to access information about the search.  The website will be live within the next several days and will be updated frequently.  The link will be:  http://www.vt.edu/provostsearch.

Nominations and Applications - With the aid of the executive search firm of Greenwood/Asher, we are casting a wide net to attract the very best candidates.  In that regard, we are seeking your help as well.  As you interact with your professional associations and colleagues throughout the country and around the world, please give thought to individuals who you think would be good candidates and send any nominations to the search firm (see below).  Initial screening of applications will begin immediately and will continue until an appointment is made.

Individuals who wish to nominate a candidate should submit a letter of nomination including contact information for the nominee.  Application materials should include a letter addressing how the candidate's experiences match the position requirements, a curriculum vitae or resumé, and five references. Submission of materials as PDF attachments is strongly encouraged.  Confidential inquiries, nominations, and application materials should be directed to:
