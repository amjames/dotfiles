Hello Dr. Mayhall,=20

I am Andrew James (AJ) a first year student in Dr. Crawford=E2=80=99s =
Group at Virginia Tech, we got to meet during recruitment weekend.  I am =
writing to ask if you would be a member of my PhD advisory committee.=20

During the second semester of the first year I am supposed to select 3 =
faculty members to make up my advisory committee along with Dr. =
Crawford. The committee members responsibilities include grading my =
programatic assessments such as the Literature Review, Prelim exam, =
original research proposal, and finally the defense.  There is also a =
requirement that we have an assessment meeting once a year, however, in =
many cases one of those assessments I have already listed will count for =
that meeting. =20

There is a form that the committee members normally sign to show they =
agree to be a committee member.  This form is my =E2=80=9Cplan of =
study=E2=80=9D; it states when I plan on completing all of the =
requirements of the degree, and the additional courses I plan to take.  =
Dr. Morris has said they would accept an email from you in place of a =
physical signature.  I can send you that document so you can look it =
over once I have all of my committee members confirmed.  Please let me =
know if you are able to be on my committee. =20

Regards,
AJ
