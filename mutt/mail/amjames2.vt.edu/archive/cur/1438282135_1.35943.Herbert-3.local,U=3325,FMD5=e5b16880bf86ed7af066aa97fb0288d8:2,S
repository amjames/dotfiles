Hello,

I  recently received a bill for $169.00 for the renewal of my ACS =
membership.  I believe there has been some error. I am a first year =
graduate student and Should not be paying this much.  Secondly I notice =
that I am also being charged for C&EN.  This is not something I want, =
nor have I ever wanted it.  I will not be re-hewing until these issues =
can be resolved please let me know how I can do so. Thank you.=20
