Hello Prof. Morris,=20

I wanted to ask a question about the advisory committee professors.  =
During recruitment weekend I was able to meet and speak with Dr. Nick =
Mayhall who will be joining the department in the fall.  I would like to =
ask him to be a member of my committee, and I wanted to know if this was =
possible  since he is not here yet. If it is possible how should I go =
about doing that.  I know members of the committee normally have to sign =
off on the plan of study, and he would not be able to do that until he =
moves here. =20

Thanks,=20
