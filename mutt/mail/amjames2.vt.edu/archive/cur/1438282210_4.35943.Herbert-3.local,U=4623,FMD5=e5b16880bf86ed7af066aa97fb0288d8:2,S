Hello Marcel,=20

I am sorry but I do not have any knowledge of the virtual exercises out =
side of what is in the manual. I do not have access to the virtual lab. =
There are TA=E2=80=99s availible for extra help hours in the CLC and =
online in the scholar chat who will be able to help you. These TA=E2=80=99=
s have seen the virtual lab and know it better than I would anyway. I am =
sure you can get the help you need using these resources.=20

See you in class,=20
