Hello,=20

I have put an example of the data I would like to work with in:=20

/home/amjames2/people/srijithr/example.csv

on blue-ridge.  I can also get the cartesian coordinates of the molecule =
at each time-step. I also was mistaken when we spoke earlier, my =
simulation runs for 20,000 times steps but I have take samples at every =
5th step, so there are only 4000 rows of data in this file. =20

Thanks again for your help,=20
