I'm honestly not sure if she needs to register or not.  CPE is putting
together the accommodations, dining plans, and teaching spaces, so they at
least need to know the numbers to make sure the room is large enough.  I'm
copying this to AJ (who is organizing for us) to inquire.

AJ, please ask Jessica about how we should deal with local students who
don't need accommodations (and possibly not dining plans =E2=80=93 though w=
e might
give them food anyway to allow them to interact with the other students).

  Daniel, I want Jessi to attend, does she need to apply or can we just
handle her offline? She obviously won't need any support other than a seat
in the room.
