I misunderstood the first email, thanks I have got it now.=20

I have one more question though.  One student in this section has 4 50=92s=
 and a 56 he handed in a pre-lab for the ideal gas law, or part of one =
rather and then missed a few weeks and never handed in the post lab for =
that lab.  Does that 56 save him or does it count as a 50? There is =
another student who has 6 50=92s so she will be changed to an F, but I =
want to make sure I do the right thing here for this other student. =20

Thanks,=20
