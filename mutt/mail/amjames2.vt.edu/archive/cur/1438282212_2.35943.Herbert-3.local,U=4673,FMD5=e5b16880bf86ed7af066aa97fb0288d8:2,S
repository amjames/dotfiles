To: Chem 1046 TA Group<p/>From: Victoria Long<p/>Good morning all - a few things to review with your students this week in lab:<br/>
<br/>
1. Make sure you have a seating chart and make sure your students know their lab bench.<br/>
2. Let them know that beginning in experiment 7 we are moving to prelab online quizzes rather than prelab reports.<br/>
3. Let them know they will still be required to have their notebooks prepared.<br/>
4. Also, let them know to look for an email from me most likely Wed. with information regarding the prelab quizzes<br/>
- they MUST READ this email!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Vicki Long<br/>
