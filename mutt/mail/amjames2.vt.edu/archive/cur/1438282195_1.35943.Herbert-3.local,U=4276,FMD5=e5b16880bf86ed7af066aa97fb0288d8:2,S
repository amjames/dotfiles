Hi Joli,

First of thanks for the message I didn't know that the payroll deduction
would be stopped each semester.  If I signed back up for that am I good to
go or is there something else I need to do? I can't see anything on Hokie
spa that says I am going loose my assistant-ship or that my bill is late.
