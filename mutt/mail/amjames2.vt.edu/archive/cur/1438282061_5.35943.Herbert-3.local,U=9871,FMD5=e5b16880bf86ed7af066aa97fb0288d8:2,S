I will stress to those students they have to let me know asap.=20

There is one =E2=80=9Clocal" student Javier Crezado who is already in a =
room in housing. He is a post-doc in our lab for the next two months =
actually, and plans on attending the school while he is here.  The =
second student never registered or contacted me again.=20

Thanks
