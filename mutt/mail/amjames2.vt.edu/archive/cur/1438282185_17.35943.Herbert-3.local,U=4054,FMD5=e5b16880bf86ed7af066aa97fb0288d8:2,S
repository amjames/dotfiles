Hello Dr. Crawford,  

Fabijan shared this link with me about a week long summer school on electronic structure theory and other areas of theoretical chemistry in July.  I wanted to know what you thought about me applying to this? It appears that accepted applicants are reimbursed for the cost of registration and accommodations as well.  The application requires one letter of recommendation and would be due on the first of February. I know it is short notice, but I figured there is no harm in asking. 

I hope you are feeling well, and thank you.
