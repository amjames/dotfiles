Hello Andrew,
    I hope you had a good weekend. I have a couple of questions about this
week's post lab. For Beer's Law Equation, A = e x b x [ ], I understand
that I have the A is the absorption that we found in lab, b is the
wavelength (453 or 616), and  [ ] is the concentration. However, what
exactly is e besides being the molar absorptivity. What does that mean to
me in terms for having to solve for Kc? Also the power point says that
absorbance is a direct measurement of concentration. So does that mean the
the absorbance levels we found are the concentrations? Would the
concentration of the solution be the initial molarity of the NaOH and HCl?
OR do we use the pH found before reading the absorption by using the
equation [H30+] = 10^-pH to find concentration? Also I have read and reread
the chem manual and I am puzzled as to which equation is the right one to
use. Am I suppose to solve for e? Do I need e? I am so confused. If you
have any wisdom to share I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks you for your time
