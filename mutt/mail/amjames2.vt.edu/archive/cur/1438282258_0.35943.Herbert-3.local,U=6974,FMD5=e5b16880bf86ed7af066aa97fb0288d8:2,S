	Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s the home stretch and the end is in sight.<br/>
	<br/>
	Having said that, please make sure all of your students&#39; grades are posted in Scholar.&nbsp; We need to have them completed by Wednesday, May 6.<br/>
	<br/>
	DO NOT, HOWEVER, UPLOAD TO HOKIE SPA.&nbsp; Vicki will be sending out a note with instruction for that.<br/>
	<br/>
	If you need help with your grading, ask.&nbsp; We cannot have ungraded/not uploaded grades for students.&nbsp; There were a lot of empty grade slots in Chem 1046.&nbsp;<br/>
	<br/>
	Since Vicki is out for additional surgery, I ask for your immediate attention to this. I need all the help I can get.<br/>
	<br/>
	Thanks for all you do.</p>
<p>
	Mrs. Dalton</p>
