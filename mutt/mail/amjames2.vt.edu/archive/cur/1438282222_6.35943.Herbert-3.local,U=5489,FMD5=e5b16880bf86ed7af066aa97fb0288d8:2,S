<br/>
I need you to take the prelab quizzes and report any issues to ma asap. I would like to open these quizzes tomorrow, and need to correct any problems you come across.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am not planning a TA meeting as we have so many returning TAs. If you&#39;re a new TA I contact you separately. Please note I have placed the GCMS and AA training power points in the resource folder in scholar. Please review these prior to starting the next round robin experiments.&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
We will have Jie and Evan helping the next round robin for instrument support, but we expect that TAs can provide the students a basic lecture for both GCMS and AA, and assist in describing and analyzing their data.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Vicki Long<br/>

Good afternoon 1046 TAs! All seems to be going well in the labs, and we will finish the last experiment in round robin 1 next week. As such, we will begin the final round robin the following week. So here&#39;s a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1. <strong>ALL TAs please take the prelab quizzes for exp. 10, 11, 12</strong> no later than Monday (3/30) at 5 pm. Please email me any concerns regarding the quiz&nbsp; - being sure to screen shot the question and or answer you have a concern about. Use the quiz to help you prepare for the next (and final) three experiments.<br/>
<br/>
2. We will have a <strong>TA meeting next week</strong>. This will be mandatory of any TA that has not TA&#39;ed 1046 before. I will have Jie and Evan run the meeting, as we will need to train you on the GCMS and AA. As soon as we confirmed an evening, we&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and have a good evening - Vicki Long<p>----------------------<br>This forwarded message was sent via Scholar Messages from the  "Gen Chem TA Site S15" site.
