I actually started on one last night, but I was hoping to hear back from =
parking services about the parking permits by this morning. =20

Here is the draft.=20

Subject Software Summer School Application Status=20
Hello,=20

We are happy to announce that your application to the 2015 =
Software-Development Summer School
for Computational Chemistry, Biomolecular Simulation, and Materials =
Modeling has been accepted!

The next step is to secure your place in the program by going to this =
webpage to formally register.
http://www.cpe.vt.edu/reg/sss/

When you have made your travel arrangements I ask that you please send =
me an email (amjames2@vt.edu).
If you will be flying I will need to know the flight number, airline and =
the scheduled arrival/departure time of your arriving and departing =
flights.  We will use this information to arrange transportation to and =
from Roanoke airport.=20

If you are driving to campus I will need to get you a temporary parking =
permit, and give you instructions on where you can park. *(parking =
services has not gotten back to me yet about this).

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Looking =
forward to meeting you in June!

Sincerely,
Andrew M. James
Summer School Coordinator =20

I sent another email to parking services. I could request information =
from the students driving at a later date if we find out we need it.=20
