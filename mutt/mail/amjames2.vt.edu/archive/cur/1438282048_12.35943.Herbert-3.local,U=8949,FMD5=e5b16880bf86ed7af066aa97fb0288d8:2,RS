Dear Andrew,

Thank you for your email. I'm very happy that I can be accepted by this =
program. I have a question about the schedule, there seems to be an =
inconsistency on the website: the home page and the register page said =
the program will start on June 22nd, however on the agenda page, the =
schedule is said to start on June 21st. So when should I arrive at the =
school, June 20th, June 21st, or June 22nd? Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Chang Liu
