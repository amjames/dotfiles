Hello,=20

I apologize for the delay in responding to applications for the software =
summer school. We are in the process of reviewing applications right =
now; you can expect a response by the end of the week, possibly within =
the next 2-3 days. We understand that students are going to need to make =
travel plans and may also have other opportunities waiting for a =
response.  I apologize again and look for an email soon.  Thank you for =
your patience.=20
