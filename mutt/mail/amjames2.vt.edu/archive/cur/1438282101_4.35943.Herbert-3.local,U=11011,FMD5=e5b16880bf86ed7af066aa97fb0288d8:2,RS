Andrew,

I wasn't anticipating being in Blacksburg until around 9pm by car and I see
regular check-in hours end at 7pm. I will try my best to be there within
these hours but what should I do if I show up after 7pm? Also, if we are
staying in the dorms will we be in a shared sleeping space (2 beds in one
room) and what facilities will we have (microwave, mini-fridge, etc.) so I
can pack accordingly. Thanks for your time.

Respectfully,
W. James Morgan
