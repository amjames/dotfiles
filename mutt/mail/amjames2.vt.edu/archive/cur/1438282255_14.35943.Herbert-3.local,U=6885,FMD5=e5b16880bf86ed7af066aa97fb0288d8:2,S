Hi Marcel,

I think you are supposed to let Mrs. Dalton, and or Mrs. Long know about
that bit in  advance. If you have already worked that out with them and you
are just letting me know then thanks! If not I would email them immediately
as it may be too late for them to make those accommodations. I have
forwarded them this conversation.


Thanks,
Andrew
