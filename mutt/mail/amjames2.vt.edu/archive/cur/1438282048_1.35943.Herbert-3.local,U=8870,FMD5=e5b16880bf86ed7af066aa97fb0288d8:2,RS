Hello, this is Jonathon Vandezande. I just registered for the SICM2. I will
be travelling by car.

As someone who has a strong background in programming, the first few days
will be a review for me. Is there need for extra help during those days? If
so, I would like to volunteer my services helping to teach others in
breakout sessions or any other time.

Thanks
-Jonathon Vandezande
