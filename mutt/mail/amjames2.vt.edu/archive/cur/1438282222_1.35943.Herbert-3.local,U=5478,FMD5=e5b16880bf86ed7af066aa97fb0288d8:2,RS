Hello Mrs. Long, and Mrs. Dalton,=20

I am forwarding you this response I received from Ramaan about the =
pre-lab quiz issue.  It appears there is a rather serious situation, and =
I am wondering if there is anything we can do ? Is there anything I am =
legally obligated to do like report this? ( I have no idea who his =
roommate is though).  I can come in after my 10AM lab if you need to =
discuss anything with me in person.=20

Thanks,=20
