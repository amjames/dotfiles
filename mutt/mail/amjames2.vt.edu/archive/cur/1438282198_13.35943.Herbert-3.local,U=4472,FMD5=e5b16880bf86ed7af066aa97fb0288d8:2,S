Dear GTA Test Proctors,

I wanted to remind you about the following:  Students who complete their
Chem 1036 tests before 8:00 pm tonight must leave their entire test copies
with you. This is very important.

Students who complete their tests after 8:00 pm only have to leave the
cover sheet with you - they can take their test copies with them.  We
really do not want to collect any more test copies than we have to, so once
8:00 pm comes, students can take their test copies, leaving you the cover
sheet only.

Patricia Amateis
Chemistry
