Extremely cold temperatures are predicted to affect the Blacksburg area beginning this afternoon and lasting through Friday. Also, an additional 1-3" of snow is expected this afternoon, and it might fall at a very intense rate with strong wind gusts. Lightning and thunder snow is also possible during this period.

Record cold is expected Thursday and Friday morning with expected temperatures to range from zero to 5 degrees below zero.  Associated wind chills could reach minus 15 to minus 25 degrees. Frostbite can occur within 30 minutes at those temperatures.

Here are some simple cold weather tips to keep you safe and protect your home or apartment.

o	If you go outside wear several layers of loose fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one heavy layer. Outer garments should be tightly woven and water repellent. Wear gloves or mittens and snow boots. Wear a hat, preferably one that covers your ears. Covering your mouth with a scarf or your hand can help protect your lungs.
o	Keep pipes from freezing inside your home or apartment by allowing faucets to drip.
o	Keep space heaters at least three feet from flammable objects and refuel outside.
o	Check on others who might not be able to care for themselves.
o	While outside, check on others for signs of frostbite or hypothermia.
