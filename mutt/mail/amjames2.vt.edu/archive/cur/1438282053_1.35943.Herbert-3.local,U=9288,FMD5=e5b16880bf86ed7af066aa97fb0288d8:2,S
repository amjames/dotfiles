Thank you for your email,
However I do still have questions:

I paid $250 for a one year permit. So about 68 cents a day of =E2=80=9Cval=
ue".=20
It expires sometime in August. Since I can=E2=80=99t remember the exact =
date lets low ball it and say it is August first.  That means I would =
have 66 days left at 68 cents a day that is about $45.20. So there is in =
fact a refund value to the permit. How do you arrive at the conclusion =
there is not?

As for me needing to hand the permit in I would gladly do so, if I had =
it. Since you say you read the email you already know I do not and I am =
discontinuing my business with this office due to your outrageous =
assessment of the value of a plastic hang-tag. Those cost at most $1 =
each. Not $20 since I already paid $250 for parking spots that seem to =
disappear every day I will not allow your office to take anymore of my =
paycheck.=20

There are two acceptable resolutions to this issue.=20
1) Refund me the $45.20
2) Give me a replacement pass at an appropriate charge.

Thank you
