Hello, 

I am a graduate from the class of 2014, and I require a copy of my
offical univeristy transcript.  I see through the online portal the
option to have printed coppies mailed somehwere, or to download and
print my un-offical transcript.  However, I need a pdf of the
transcript. Could you tell me where I can download that.  

Thanks,
Andrew M. James
