Subject:  TA Meeting Next Week

Good morning all =AD given the significant number of conflicts for the TA
meeting next week and my lack of energy by the end of the day after
crutching, I=B9m going to try a different approach for the meeting. I will be
in next week M 2/16 (12:30 =AD 4:00), T 2/17 (9:00 to 12:00) and W 2/18 (9:00
=AD 12:00). I will plan to simply meet individually with you =AD please reply t=
o
this email with a time you can meet during those hours. Since I have quite =
a
few returning 1046 TAs =AD I only need the following TAs to meet with me:
Dennis, Matthew, Kuljeet, Drew, Darren, Andrew, Shaoyang, Ming, Yunnan,
Evan, and Mingtao. The meeting will only take about 30 min.

Also, since next week you don=B9t need to be in lab you MUST get all the
grading to date caught up. This means you should have the pre and post lab
for both exp. 1 and 2 graded and posted into scholar! Also, have the prefab=
s
for exp. 3 graded. When the students return during the Feb. 23 =AD 27 week
you=B9re collecting two post labs, and one prelab. Bottom line: Grading must
be up to date and posted in scholar by the end of next week. I will be
checking. Again, this means, even if you=B9ve graded and keep grades in excel=
,
I also must see the grades in scholar!

Thanks, and those hat are meeting with me please reply with a time that
works for your schedule. Thanks, Vicki
