Dear Ramaan,=20

I noticed that you haven=E2=80=99t completed the pre-lab quiz for this =
week, and I wanted to check in to make sure everything is okay. Not =
completing those quizzes is preventing you from participating in lab and =
this will start to drag your grades down quick.  If there is something =
wrong please let us (Myself, Mrs. Long and Mrs. Dalton) know asap, and =
if not please get on top of those quizzes!=20

Take care,=20
