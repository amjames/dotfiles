Hi Jessica,

With the SSS drawing close I am adding some resources to the programs =
website for the students, and it just crossed my mind. Is there going to =
be wifi access set up for them? It would be necessary, both in their =
rooms, and in the classroom.  Can we get this set up, and do you know =
how they would log in so I can put it with the materials I am preparing =
?=20

Thanks,
Andrew=20=
