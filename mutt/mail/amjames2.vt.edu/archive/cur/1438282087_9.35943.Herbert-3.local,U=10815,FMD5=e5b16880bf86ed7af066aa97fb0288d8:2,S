Hi John,=20

I am going to send that out soon. I have actually prepared an intro =
email I will send out either tonight or tomorrow morning ( I am just =
waiting for comments/approval from the instructors and Dr. Crawford.)

But to put your mind at ease:
Roanoke airport is very small, and either myself or Harley McAlexander =
(another grad student helping out with picking up students at the =
airport) will meet you by baggage claim with a sign to indicate we are =
here for the Software School. The van will take you directly to check-in =
unless you are getting in before 11:00AM/after 7:00PM in which case we =
will have your keys and will take you to your dorm building.=20
