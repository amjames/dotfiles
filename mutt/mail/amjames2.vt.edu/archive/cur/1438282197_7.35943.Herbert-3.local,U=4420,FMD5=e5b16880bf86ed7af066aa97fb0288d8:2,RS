Hello Joli,

I am planning on dropping one of the classes I am in this semester, but
doing so would put me under 12 credits. Am I stuck here or is there
anything I can do to get more credits shifted to Research? I haven't
dropped it yet, but I am already guaranteed to get a bad grade due to a
missed deadline that has passed.

Thank you for your help,
Andrew James
