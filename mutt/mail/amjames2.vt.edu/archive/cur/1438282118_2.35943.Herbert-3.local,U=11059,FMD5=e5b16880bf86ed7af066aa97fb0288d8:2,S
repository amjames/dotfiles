Hi Jessica,=20

We have printed off a welcome brochure for the students of the Software =
Summer School. Is there somewhere I could leave a stack of them for you =
to give to the students who are coming in by car? Harley and I are going =
to give them to the students we meet at the airport. Like maybe the desk =
at New Hall West?=20

Let me know and I will drop them off. I am folding them right now! =09
