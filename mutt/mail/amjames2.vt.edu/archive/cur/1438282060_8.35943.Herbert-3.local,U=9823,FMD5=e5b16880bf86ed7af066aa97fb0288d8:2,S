Dear Laurie,=20

I have already registered with Fleet Commander last week.=20

I reported 42 for the SSS incorrectly. I should have said 41, but that =
is the number of applications we have accepted so far. I think Jessica =
may have been reporting the number of those who have come back to =
formally register for the school. I don=92t have access to see the =
registration numbers  so I have to ask Jessica for an update every so =
often.  Either way I only have gotten travel plans from 15students so =
far.  I am going to send out a reminder to those I am still waiting to =
hear from. =20

Thanks,
--AJ
