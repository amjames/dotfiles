Andrew,

Awesome! Thank you for this notification. I confirmed my attendance at the
provided link and will be driving to VT. It is a 7.5 hr drive from my
current residence so will dormitories be available the night of the 21st?
Let me know what needs to be done for the permit when parking gets back to
you. Thanks, again.

Respectfully,
W. James Morgan
