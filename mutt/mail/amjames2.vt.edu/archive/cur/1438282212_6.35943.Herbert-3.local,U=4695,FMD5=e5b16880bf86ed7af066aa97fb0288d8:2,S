Hello Rhae,=20

Consider this:=20

Does it particularly matter what e is? Absorbance is a direct =
measurement of concentration because the other factors in this equation =
are constant.  Let us consider an arbitrary example. I will have C1 and =
C2 two concentrations of the same material, and I want to find the ratio =
C1/C2

I  measure the absorbance of C1 and it is A1, similarly I measure A2 for =
C2. Now to solve for each C and find the ratio between them.

R =3D C1/C2
R =3D (A1x e x b)/(A2 x e x b)=20
so we se that e and b will cancel out and the ratio C1/C2 will infect be =
the same as the ratio of the absorbances.=20

You can do the same thing with Kc because it too is a ratio! We can take =
the ratio of the absorbances and use them rather than using =
Concentration directly!=20

I hope this helps you to start on the right track,  Best of luck.
