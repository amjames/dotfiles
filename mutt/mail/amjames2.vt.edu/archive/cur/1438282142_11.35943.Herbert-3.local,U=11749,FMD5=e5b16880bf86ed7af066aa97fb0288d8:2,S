Hello Jessica,=20

It was just brought to my attention that all of the students from the =
Software Development Summer School were turned away by the dining hall =
staff at dinner today.  The cards say that they do not expire until =
tomorrow.  The students flying out of Roanoke will be leaving all =
throughout the day, and some may need 2 meals.  Please let me know if =
there is someone I can talk to to fix this as soon as you can. I should =
be on campus until about 10PM.


Thanks,=20
