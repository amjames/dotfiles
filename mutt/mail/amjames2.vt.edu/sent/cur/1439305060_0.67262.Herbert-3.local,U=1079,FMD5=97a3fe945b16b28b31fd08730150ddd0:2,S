The Mazda is registered to me in Virgina and has never been parked on
campus. The Jeep was registered to my Father in New York. I have never
had a vehicle registered in my name in New York state. 

Thanks

Per New York vehicle registration the vehicle is owned by you with a vehicle registration expiration date of 05/22/2017. This information was received on 7/8/2015. If this information is not correct please let me know and I can check with New York motor vehicles to see if this is an error on their part. If there is not error in ownership of the vehicle the citation is a valid citation. Let me know if you have any questions.
