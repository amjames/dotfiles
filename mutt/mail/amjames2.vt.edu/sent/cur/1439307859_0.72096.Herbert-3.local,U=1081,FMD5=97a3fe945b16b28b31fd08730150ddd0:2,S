I can email it to you when I get home (if you recall a series of
emails we exchanged earlier in the summer, I can't park it on campus
because the 200 some-odd dollars you took out of my paycheck wasn't
enough, after I totaled by jeep you wanted more money to print a plastic
card to hang in my new car.)

Quite frankly I am fed up with your office, and most of the hoops I have
to jump though at this school in general. I think I may have to pursue
my degree at an institution of higher learning, not one focused on
taking every cent from graduate students they barely pay in the first
place.

Per New York vehicle registration the vehicle is owned by you with a vehicle registration expiration date of 05/22/2017. This information was received on 7/8/2015. If this information is not correct please let me know and I can check with New York motor vehicles to see if this is an error on their part. If there is not error in ownership of the vehicle the citation is a valid citation. Let me know if you have any questions.
