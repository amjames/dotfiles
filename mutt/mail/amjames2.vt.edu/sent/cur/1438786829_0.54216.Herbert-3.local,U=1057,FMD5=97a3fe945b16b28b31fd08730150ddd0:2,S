Hello,

    Yes it was as if Prof. Lischka could read my mind!

    I have been trying very hard to work through the Pulay paper, but I
    still can't figure out how do the projection or if it needs to be
    done. 
    
    Then says that finding the UHF NOs is simple and gives Eq 3.  So, I
    have been trying to find the UHF NOs by:
    1) building S^(1/2),
    2) computing S^(1/2)DS^(1/2)
    3) diagonalizing (2)
    4) the eigenvalues should be the NO occupation numbers? 

    I put a ? after 4 because that is where I find occupation numbers
    that make no sense. Pulay says that the projection only changes the
    occupation numbers, so I thought something needed to be done after I 
    had computed the NOs this way.

    How do I do a spin projection of the UHF wave function?
