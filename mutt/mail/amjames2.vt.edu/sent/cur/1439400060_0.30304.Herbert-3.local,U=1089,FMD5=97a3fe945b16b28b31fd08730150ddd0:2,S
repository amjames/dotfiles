Croix,

Thats awesome to hear, but unfortunately I wont be attending the meeting.
My boss is on the road for these past two weeks and is giving a 
lecture at the meeting (T. Daniel Crawford, you should check it out!).
So we have been scrambling to get him data to put into the presentation
which he will probably be working on right up to when they call him up
to speak haha!

I will be at the SE/SWRMACS (South East/ South West Regional ACS) meeting
in November, and hopefully the SETCA (South East Theoretical Chemistry
Association) meeting in the spring. If you find yourself at any of those
I completely agree we should get together!

Tell me about A&M! Pardon me I forget how long it has been since I
graduated, but is this for grad school or a summer REU? What/who brings
you there? Are you going to keep doing theory? 
(I am collaborating with a group on my major project right now)
