Hi Dr. Crawford, 
    
    I don't mind at all! I am very grateful for all of help, and I agree
    identifying these issues would have went much slower had you not
    stepped in.

    I have been trying to compute the UHF NOONs as described in the paper.  
    I thought we were still interested in those results, but if Prof. Lischka 
    and you don't think it will be necessary I will give that up.  If that is 
    something we need to look at I would need some help figuring out what 
    I am doing incorrectly. I have so far not been able to reproduce 
    their results (I am getting occupation numbers greater than two).

    I have continued with the computations of (4), but I was not forcing
    Cs symmetry. I can not actually get the stability analysis to converge
    in C2h (DLU solver keeps hitting the iteration limit even after I
    double the maximum). I don't know if this is concerning or not, but I have
    changed the input to run in Cs symmetry.

    Thanks,
    --AJ
