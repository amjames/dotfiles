Hi, Jerome,

I can get convergence if I set solver_n_root = 1 (since I really only want
the lowest root anyway).  I wonder if such tight default convergence
(10^-6) is necessary for most stability analyses?

However, I have another question about UHF stability analysis when coupled
to subsequent CC calculations.  Why does the stability code switch over to
PK integrals in such cases?  The SCF code runs DF-UHF to get a good guess,
then computes and stores the JK integrals to solve the UHF equations.  Then
the stability code calls the PK integral algorithm (including
transformation) to do its analysis.  Do correlated calculations following
stability analysis require the PK-based stability algorithm?
