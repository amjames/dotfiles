Daniel (and A.J.),

I agree with your sentiment that code repetition is not an issue, so =
there=E2=80=99s not much motivation to put it in OEProp.  I think NO =
formation should be handled by Wavefunction, because then the NOs can be =
easily handed off to a CAS code, without needing a property calculation =
in between.  I like the idea of being able to run a CC/CI/MP2 =
calculation with a "compute_nos true=E2=80=9D flag, and knowing on exit =
that the wavefunction object will automagically contain the NOs.  If =
your printing machinery were added to Wavefunction itself, that would =
simplify the process of making sure computing and printing correlated =
NOs is consistent.
