Laurie,

Regarding the munchables:  Smaller number of edibles is better.  My
observation is that there are lots of leftovers so let's minimize that.  No
juice in the morning, but do have soda in the afternoon.  I had even though
about dropping the afternoon breaks entirely, but I think perhaps they're
still needed.  What's your opinion?

I think we're leaning toward an informal opening reception =E2=80=93 perhap=
s just
emailing all the students and saying, "Hey, if you get here in time, please
come to XXX to have a drink and chat."  Opinions?

However, I am thinking about using the bowling place for the Saturday-night
social even on the weekend for the SSS.

The account for the MRPSS vans is 479325.

-TDC
