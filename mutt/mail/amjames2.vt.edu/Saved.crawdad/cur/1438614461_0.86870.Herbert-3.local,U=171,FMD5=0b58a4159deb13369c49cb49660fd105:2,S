Dear Justin,

(1) I tried to login on one of the hpcXX accounts using both the hokies14
and chemistry passwords, but without success.  Perhaps I'm doing something
wrong?

(2) I don't think we'll really need a 40-node reservation.  Why don't we
cut it down to 20 nodes?  Would that help?

Thanks for your help!

-Daniel
