Hi, all,

If it's all right with you, I'd like to have our individual meetings in my
office rather than the lab today.  I have some code-related things to
discuss with AJ, Jean, and Ashutosh, and it's easiest for me if we can do
that at my desktop computer.

I don't care about the order you choose to come to meet.  I'll be ready to
get started at 2:00pm as scheduled.

Thanks!

-TDC
