Dear AJ,

This is a good start.  Here are my quick responses:

(1) Make sure to address each student individually and send each acceptance
under separate cover.  This will help them feel more welcome and less of a
statistic. :)

(2) You should explicitly state in your second paragraph that, even though
the registration page mentioned credit cards, there is no charge for
participating in the Summer School.

Thanks for handling this!

-TDC
