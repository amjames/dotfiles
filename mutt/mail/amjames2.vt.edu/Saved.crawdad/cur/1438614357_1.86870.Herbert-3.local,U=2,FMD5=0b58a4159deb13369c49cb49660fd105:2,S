Dear AJ,

Sorry to be slow to respond, but the holidays and some health issues have
held me up.  Regarding your question about vibrationally averaged specific
rotations for these molecules, there are papers on this, and below are some
pointers.  We can discuss details either via email or after we're both back
in Blacksburg, but hopefully the below will get you started with some
interesting reading.

Best regards and happy new year!
