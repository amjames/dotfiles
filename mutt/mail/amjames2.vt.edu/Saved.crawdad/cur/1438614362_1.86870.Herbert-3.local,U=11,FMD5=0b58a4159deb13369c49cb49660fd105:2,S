Regarding the computation in the directory you noted, the cclambda() call
must follow cchbar().  The latter produces the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian, which is needed for the solution to the lambda equations.
Give that a try.

It is not normal for jobs on cerebra to be in the queue for so long.  I
suspect that the jobs may be "stuck" -- have parameters that actually will
not allow them to run at all.  Ask Harley, Ben, or Ashutosh for some
assistance there.
