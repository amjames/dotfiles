Dear AJ,

I looked back over the material Prof. Lischka sent.  Your calculations
right now (correct me if I'm wrong) are focused primarily on obtaining
natural orbital occupation numbers using CCSD.  (Note that soon we'll be
able to obtain CCSD(T) densities as well, but I'll need some time to finish
coding.)  One thing I hadn't realized before is that most of these systems
have open-shell ground states, which complicates our calculations somewhat
in that we must use both ROHF-CC and UHF-CC methods.  We have one-electron
densities for both of these methods, though I don't know if we've tested
the natural orbital calculations for ROHF references yet.  I compute both
D1 and D2 diagnostics for ROHF references, but there exists nothing more
than T1 diagnostics for UHF references.

I think the key quantities that Prof. Lischka wants (so far) are: natural
orbital occupation numbers for the active space (non-frozen orbitals), T1,
D1, and D2 diagnostics.

What systems have you run computations for so far, and what data have you
collected?  Please also send me the directory names where you're running
the computations so I can look them over myself and offer suggestions, if
necessary.

Thanks for taking this project on!
