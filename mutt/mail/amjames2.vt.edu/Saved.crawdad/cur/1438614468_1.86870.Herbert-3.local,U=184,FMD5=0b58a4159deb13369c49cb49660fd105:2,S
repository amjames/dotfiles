Dear Jessica,

I believe that Laurie had asked for some additional dining cards for the
instructors and AJ to use to increase interactions with the students.  Do
you know how we can get to those?

Regarding the bathroom situation, could you ask the dormitory folks to put
a note under the doors of the students affected by the bathroom
reassignment?  After thinking about it, I'd prefer not to have to make an
announcement about this in our sessions, and I feel it's the housing folks'
job to communicate the problem.

Thanks for your help!

-Daniel
