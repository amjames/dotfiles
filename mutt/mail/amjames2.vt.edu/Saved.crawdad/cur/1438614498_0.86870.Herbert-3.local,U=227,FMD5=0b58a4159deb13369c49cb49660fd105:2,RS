I can't see the website yet because I can't clone your repo (my connection
is too slow), so go ahead and upload it, and I'll just examine the site
directly.

You draft message looks fine.  Two changes: (1) "There are also
instructions..." (2) Send a link to the SSS main page so the students can
see your changes.   Otherwise it's fine so go ahead and send.
