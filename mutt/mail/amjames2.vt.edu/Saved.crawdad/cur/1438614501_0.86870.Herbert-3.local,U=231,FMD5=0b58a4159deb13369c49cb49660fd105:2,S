Hi, Brian,

I think one or two GRAs would be a big help, especially as we try to get
things off the ground Monday morning.  There will inevitably be technical
issues to handle, especially the first day.  We had two GRAs helping when
we put the school together two years ago, but they didn't have much to do
after things were running smoothly, and I don't want to waste anyone's
time.  If we need them beyond the first day, I'll let you know.

We'll be getting started at 9:00am on Monday in Goodwin Hall 135.

Thanks!

-TDC
