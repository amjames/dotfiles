Dear Greg and Tommy,

Once again, we are planning to hold a Software Summer School for
computational chemistry.  This year's school will be held at Virginia Tech,
June 2-July 1, and so I am writing to invite the Software Carpentry team to
participate for a third year in a row.  The response from the students the
last two years =E2=80=93 at Virginia Tech in 2013 and at Stony Brook U. las=
t year =E2=80=93
has been very positive, and we hope you'll be willing to give it another
whirl.  If you're able and interested, we would be happy to cover your
travel expenses, just as before.  Please let me know if you might be able
to participate.

I hope to hear from you soon!

Best regards,

-Daniel
