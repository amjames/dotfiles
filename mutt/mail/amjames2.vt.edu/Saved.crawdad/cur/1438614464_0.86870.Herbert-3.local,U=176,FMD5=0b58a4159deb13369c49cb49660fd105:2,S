Dear AJ,

(1) Polyradicals: Simply running the singlets with a UHF reference will
likely not reveal the open-shell nature of the singlet wave function
because the starting alpha and beta densities will be identical.  We may
need to carry out an MO stability analysis and use that to obtain
spin-polarized orbitals.  Try using the keyword "stability_analysis =3D
follow" and see what happens.

(2) Thanks for handling the instructor accounts on sirius.  I'll write to
them and let them know.  Just leave the social activities as TBA for the
moment.

Thanks!

-TDC
