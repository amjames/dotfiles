Guys,

We are very likely to have bad weather tomorrow, especially in the
afternoon, and I currently consider it unlikely that I will be able to go
to Arlington tomorrow night for my meetings at the NSF on Tuesday and
Wednesday.  I still would like to meet tomorrow, if possible, but I don't
think we can keep our afternoon meeting times in place.  Please remind me
of your schedules for Monday morning until just after lunch.
