Great start, AJ!  Here are a few comments/suggestions:

(1) I think we'll have to find either a different photo for the main splash
page or a higher-resolution image than the one you have.  In addition, the
white font becomes unreadable in front of the snowy roof.  Also, I think a
springtime image would be better for attracting potential students. :)

(2) Can you shift the SICM2 logo a bit so that it's top-to-bottom centered
in the header?   Similarly, the header menu items (Home, Institute,
Agenda...) need to shift down just a bit.

(3) I'll provide you with additional information on the instructors,
agenda, etc. soon.
