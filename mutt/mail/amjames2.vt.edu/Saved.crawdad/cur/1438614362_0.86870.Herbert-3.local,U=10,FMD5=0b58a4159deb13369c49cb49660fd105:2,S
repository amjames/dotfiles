Hi, all,

A few points to note this week:

(1) I'll be traveling to the sprawling metropolis of Lubbock, Texas
<https://goo.gl/maps/LEMsX>, this week to speak at Texas Tech.  I'll leave
on Tuesday after my pchem lecture and return in the late afternoon on
Thursday.

(2) I'd like to have group meeting on Friday, if possible.  Would 4pm
work?  If not, please send me times you're available that day.  Since we
won't be able to have individual meetings this week, let's make our agenda
an update on everyone's projects and setting up the schedule for the
remainder of the semester.

(3) AJ, could we meet tomorrow (Monday) to discuss the acene project in
advance of my departure for Texas Tech?  Let me know some times you're
available.  I promised you last week some feedback on organizing your data,
so look for a separate email from me on that shortly.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

-TDC
