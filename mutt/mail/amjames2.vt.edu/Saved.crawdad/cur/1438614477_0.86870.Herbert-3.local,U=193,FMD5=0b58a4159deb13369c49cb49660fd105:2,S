Yes, I think so.  Does that sound reasonable, AJ?

Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I have had a brief phone meeting with Daniel and made adjustments in the pr=
ogramme in line with what we came up with:<br>
<br>
1. Daniel had a tentative arrangement for a hike, I figured it sounded grea=
t and decided to officially put it into the program.<br>
<br>
2. We decided to skip the poster session since it is late and only one stud=
ent asked for it.<br>
<br>
3. Daniel agreed to contribute another hour of CC theory and I gladly added=
 it to the Wednesday program.<br>
<br>
4. Otherwise times are slightly shifted by 30 minutes and I added coffee br=
eaks that Daniel has booked two per day.<br>
<br>
I think that covers the changes I&#39;ve made and I think we are close to f=
inalizing the program now.<br>
<br>
The only other thing we talked about was to go out for dinner (the four of =
us) on Sunday evening after we arrive to Blacksburg. So that is now also on=
 our agenda.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s it.<br>

Best,<br>
Patrick.<br>
