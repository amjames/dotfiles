Hi, Tommy,

Glad you guys made it to town.  The meet-and-greet tonight will be informal
and starts at around 7pm at Sharkey's at the corner of Main St. and College
Ave. (center of downtown B'burg).  We decided not to arrange a reception,
but just let people get together and chat a bit before tomorrow's
sessions.  I'll be there for a little while, as will AJ in between trips to
the airport.

The classes will be in Goodwin Hall, which is indeed a brand new building
on Prices Fork Rd.  Our room is 135, and I think it will suit us nicely.
Here's an interactive map that includes Goodwin:
