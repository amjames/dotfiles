I appreciate your taking the initiative, but I think we need to make the
agenda more vague at this point.  How about this, as a first guess:

Monday, June 29th: Fundamentals
Tuesday June 30th: Electromagnetic Theory
Wednesday, July 1st: Approximate Response Theory
Thursday, July 2nd: Polarizability and Related Properties
Friday, July 3rd: Advanced Spectroscopic Methods

You could also indicate at the top that each day will consist of lectures
and discussion, followed by instructor-guided exercises.  After that's in
place, we'll ask Kenneth, Trond, and Patrick for feedback.

Thanks, AJ!
