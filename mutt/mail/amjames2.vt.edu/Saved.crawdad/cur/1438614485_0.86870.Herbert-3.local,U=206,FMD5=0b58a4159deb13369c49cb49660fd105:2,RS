Hi, all,

You and the students for the Software Summer School will have access to the
BlueRidge computing cluster here at Virginia Tech.  The machine's specs are
here:

http://www.arc.vt.edu/resources/hpc/blueridge.php

I'm hoping the software setup on the machine will be acceptable, keeping in
mind that the students do not need especially advanced instruction.
Nevertheless, if you need something in particular, let me know and I'll
work with our Advanced Research Computing group.

You can't login directly to the cluster from off campus, so we've prepared
bridging accounts for you on my group's server, sirius.chem.vt.edu.  Your
logins are:

Eugene DePrince: dprince
Daniel Chen: dcheny
Tommy Guy: tguy
Robert Harrison: rjharrison *

Your password is the same as your username, except for Robert, who already
had an account on sirius.  Robert, if you don't remember your password,
we'll reset it for you.

Once you've logged in to sirius, you can ssh to blueridge1.arc.vt.edu using:

Eugene DePrince: hpc01
Daniel Chen: hpc02
Tommy Guy: hpc03
Robert Harrison: hpc04

The password you'll need is currently "hokies14", but they're trying to
change it to "chemistry."  So, if your login stops working, try the latter.

Let me know if this is sufficient to get us started.  I'm sure there'll be
issues to resolve.

Best regards,

-Daniel
