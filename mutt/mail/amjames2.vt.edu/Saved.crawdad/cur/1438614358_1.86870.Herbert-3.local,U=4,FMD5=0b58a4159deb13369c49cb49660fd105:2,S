Hi, all,

My surgery last Friday evening went fine, and I'm slowly recovering. I
don't want to let more time pass than necessary before we meet again to
make sure your projects are moving forward, but I'm still far from 100% on
my energy scale.  Instead of meeting individually today, what would you
think about a whole group meeting at around 2pm?  That way you can let me
know your status and ask questions, but I can also avoid overdoing it.  If
this will not work, please let me know.

-TDC
