Hi, all,

We've got a group lunch coming up Thursday @ noon, and I look forward to
seeing you all there.  Also, I've asked Javier to give a group meeting in
the near future on his work in Pisa and the FCClasses code.  However, our
schedule has become a bit tight, because we have a lot going on in the next
few weeks.

First, we have the Software Summer School June 22-July1, and the Molecular
Response Property Summer School June 29-July 3.  Second, I mentioned in our
discussions yesterday that I'd like to dedicate some of our group meetings
this summer to point group theory.  I anticipate we'd need about eight
meetings to cover the subject properly, though I'm not sure of the error
bars on that guess.  The next question relates to the timing of our
meetings, particularly given the complication of the summer schools.  With
this in mind, please give me your opinion: should be have one, two, or
three meetings per week, along with some exercises to drive the material
home?  And what days of the week are best?  Should we wait to start the
meetings until after the two summer schools are finished, i.e. after the
first week of July, or should we start right away?  Note that, after the
summer schools, I am not traveling until the beginning of August, so
there's flexibility that month.   Also, I'm away most of next week on
family business.

I welcome your opinions as to how best to schedule our group events in the
next few weeks.  Please let me know your constraints and preferences.

-TDC
