Two more items on the molecular response properties summer school:

(1)  "their" is misspelled a couple of times.

(2) For the response properties school, we will not require students to
submit a letter of recommendation or a statement about how the program will
help his/her research.  Since the students are paying in this case, we're
pretty much taking the first ~40 applicants.  Thus, we'll only need to drop
in the registration link from VT conference services.

n so you don=E2=80=99t have go looking for it.<br>
<br>
(1) The homepage: I changed around the presenters (now instructors) section=
. I added pictures of each and their affiliations. And the topic they will =
talk about. Each name is a link to that persons faculty page and once we kn=
ow who will be coming from software carpentry for certain I can expand that=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 -What should the deadline be?<br>
<br>
(2) The agenda page:I have put videos/slides Here in the individual panels =
rather than the front page. I don=E2=80=99t entirely love how the side pane=
l looks, and it isn=E2=80=99t really nesesary at this point should I move t=
he videos and slides here?=C2=A0 Should I mention that there will be an act=
ivity the first night to meet the other students?<br>
<br>
(3) The Student page: I put a map in showing Blacksburg and Roanoke with a =
