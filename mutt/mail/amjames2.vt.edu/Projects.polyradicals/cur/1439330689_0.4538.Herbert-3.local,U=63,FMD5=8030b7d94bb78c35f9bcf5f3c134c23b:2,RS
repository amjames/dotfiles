Hi, AJ,

I hope it's all right that I've been stepping in on this project so much
lately.  It's not that I don't trust your results, but I'm trying to engage
more than I have up to now.  In addition, I think the issues with
convergence and identification of the orbital instabilities have required
both of us.

Let me know how things are going for you in my absence and if you have any
questions or concerns.  Let me know what you're working on right now and
how I can help.

-TDC
