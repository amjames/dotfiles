Dear Hans,

I also agree that we have resolved the discrepancy between our UHF wave
functions, and we're working now to obtain the CCSD NOs using the Cs
symmetry-broken orbitals as a reference.  These NOs are obtained by
diagonalization of the spin-orbital density (including its UHF component),
and the occupations AJ has reported are the sum of the alpha and beta
contributions.  I think this is consistent with your approach.

Our stability code has gone through an overhaul in the last two weeks,
which has slowed our efforts further, but obtaining the data for this paper
is high on our priority list.  We'll let you know as soon as we have useful
results.

Best regards,

-Daniel

    Dear Daniel,<br>
    <br>
    I am back in Lubbock and followed Anita&#39;s and your comments. I thin=
k
    the agreement in the H.F. calculations is resolved. I expect that
    the NO occupations according to Pulay will also agree. The next
    question is how does the new UHF wavefunction affect the CCSD
    results. I imagine that one should compute a total density matrix
    from the CCSD wavefunction as well. Don&#39;t you think?<br>
    What kind of NO occupations and NOs did you use first? These were in
    the set of alpha and beta spin orbitals. The space parts are not
    orthogonal to each other. Thus, they are difficult to interpret. The
    advantage of diagonalizing the total spin density matrix is that the
    resulting NOs refer to the same basis. This question is more
    involved than I thought.<br>

                                    the Ag eigenvector will not destroy
                                    the spatial symmetry of the orbitals

                                  <div>(3) I&#39;m re-running our
                                    calculations forcing Cs symmetry in
                                    order to push the Bu MO Hessian
                                    eigenvector into the totally
                                    symmetric irrep.=C2=A0 That will allow =
us
                                    to make a proper comparison of our
                                    UHF-CCSD wave function natural
                                    orbitals using the same MO basis
                                    that you have for the MRAQCC
                                    calculations.=C2=A0 I should be able to
                                    report back relatively soon.</div>

                                                <br>
                                                I am attaching the
                                                analysis of zethrene
                                                which Anita sent me.
                                                Currently, I am in
                                                Vienna and have only
                                                e-mail contact. I added
                                                some comments to her
                                                text. It is written with
                                                Track Changes, mainly
                                                for her information.<br>
                                                It seems to me that
                                                polarizing the Ag
                                                orbitals we get
                                                practically the same
                                                results as you, as much
                                                as I could see form the
                                                orbital energies.
                                                However, it would be
                                                good to know also your
                                                total energies and to
                                                compare the shape of the
                                                HOMO and LUMO.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                From the first stability
                                                analysis one would say
                                                that also the orbitals
                                                should be polarized in
                                                bu symmetry. It is
                                                surprising that this
                                                instability vanishes
                                                after modifying the ag
                                                orbitals. <br>
                                                In order to take into
                                                account the bu
                                                instability we performed
                                                a calculation in Cs
                                                symmetry and got a
                                                significant
                                                stabilization with
                                                respect to the ag step.
                                                Please see the attached
                                                file for details. Please
                                                note that the symmetry
                                                labels C2h and Cs refers
                                                only to the MOs! The
                                                geometry had been fixed
                                                for all calculations
                                                reported here at C2h
                                                symmetry.<br>
                                                With the broken Cs MOs
                                                we have also made
                                                geometry optimization
                                                getting an additional
                                                stabilization, but this
                                                is not considered here.<br>
                                                <br>
                                                Could you do similar
                                                calculations for
                                                comparison?<br>

                                                          from the fact
                                                          that Anita

                                                          Finally, we
                                                          decided to

                                                          should also

                                                          Thus, the MOs

                                                          orbitals are

                                                          respectively.

                                                          should be
                                                          correct.
                                                          However, we
                                                          will explain
