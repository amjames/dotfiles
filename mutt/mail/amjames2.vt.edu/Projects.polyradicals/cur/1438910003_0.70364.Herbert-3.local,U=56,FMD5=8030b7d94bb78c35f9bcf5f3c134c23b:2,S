Hans,

We have no computed UHF NOs yet, but I do not think this is necessary, as
the orbital energies and total energies (as well as MO Hessian eigenvalues)
are sufficiently close.  Unless you think there's another reason to do this=
?

              <br>
              I am back in Lubbock and followed Anita&#39;s and your
              comments. I think the agreement in the H.F. calculations
              is resolved. I expect that the NO occupations according to
              Pulay will also agree. The next question is how does the
              new UHF wavefunction affect the CCSD results. I imagine
              that one should compute a total density matrix from the
              CCSD wavefunction as well. Don&#39;t you think?<br>
              What kind of NO occupations and NOs did you use first?
              These were in the set of alpha and beta spin orbitals. The
              space parts are not orthogonal to each other. Thus, they
              are difficult to interpret. The advantage of diagonalizing
              the total spin density matrix is that the resulting NOs
              refer to the same basis. This question is more involved
              than I thought.<br>

                                                          alpha and beta
                                                          orbitals are

                                                          respectively.
                                                          Thus, the
