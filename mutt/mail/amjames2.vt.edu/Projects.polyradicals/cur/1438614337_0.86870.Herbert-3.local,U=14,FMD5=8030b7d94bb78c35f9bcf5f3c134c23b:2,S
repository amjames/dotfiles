Well, this is the heart of what concerns me.  Again, consider the
phenalenyl radical as an example.  A H=C3=BCckel-type analysis suggests tha=
t
there should be 13 pi MOs: six doubly occupied, one singly occupied, and
six unoccupied.  Initially I thought we should use that entire space for
our CC computations, but freeze everything else.  However, the ROHF and UHF
MO energies for the HOMO-5 (active) and HOMO-6 (frozen) are nearly
identical, which suggests that the partitioning between pi and sigma is not
so clear.  I'm not sure it would be reasonable to trust such a computation.

                            It is good to hear about your progress.<br>
                            Our procedure concerning the active orbitals
                            for the CASSCF is a pragmatic one. First of
                            all, the CASSCF calculation does not stand
                            alone, it is only meant to provide
                            appropriate orbitals for the subsequent MRCI
                            and MR-AQCC calculations. The CAS space
                            increases exponentially and very soon gets
                            out of hand. At the MRCI and MR-AQCC all
                            orbitals not frozen are correlated, with the
                            AQCC calculation even higher (quadruple)
                            excitations included explicitly. Thus, our
                            focus is more on the construction of the
                            reference space for MR-AQCC than having an
                            extensive CASSCF space. For the choice of
                            the reference space NO occupations of test
                            AQCC calculations and the analysis of the
                            major contributions to the wavefunction were
                            used.=C2=A0 We have a occupation threshold of
                            ~0.05-0.1 e. Orbitals for which the NO
                            occupation deviates=C2=A0 from 2 and 0,
                            respectively,=C2=A0 more than that are included
                            into the active space. Anita also looked at
                            DFT orbital energies, to my knowledge.=C2=A0 Sh=
e
                            can give more information when needed.
                            Another point was that the non-Kekule
                            systems have D3h symmetry and we can use
                            only C2v. Thus, we do not have good control
                            over degenerate orbitals. Thus, sometimes a
                            bit of experimenting was necessary in order
                            to balance the choice of orbitals and not to
                            let one degenerate component in the active
                            space and the other one in the virtual
                            space.<br>
                            <br>
                            The size of 7 orbitals is certainly not a
                            hard limit, it was chosen out of
                            convenience. I am even not sure at the
                            moment whether all cases calculated have the
                            same CAS size at CASSCF level. As I said
                            before, it is more the choice of the
                            reference space for the AQCC calculation
                            which is important for us.<br>

                                    <div>In the meantime, I have a
                                      question about the choice of
                                      active spaces for these systems.=C2=
=A0
                                      From the material that Anita
                                      provided, it&#39;s clear that you&#39=
;ve
                                      decided not to include the entire
                                      =CF=80-MO space in these systems.=C2=
=A0 For
                                      example, for phenalenyl, the full
                                      =CF=80 space would be 13 orbitals.=C2=
=A0
                                      However, your CASSCF calculations
                                      limited the space only to seven
                                      MOs.=C2=A0 From looking at the ROHF o=
r
                                      UHF orbital energies for that
                                      system, I can see why this would
                                      be a good idea, as those seven MOs
                                      have rather isolated energies
                                      (more than 0.1 Eh away from their
                                      nearest energetic neighbors).=C2=A0
                                      Furthermore, I note that including
                                      the full 13 =CF=80 MOs results exclud=
es
                                      an occupied MO that is quite close

                                      apart from the energy separation
                                      issue and the computational
