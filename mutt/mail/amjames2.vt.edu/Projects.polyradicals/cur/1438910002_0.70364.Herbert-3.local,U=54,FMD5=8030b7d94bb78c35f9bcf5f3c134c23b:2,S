    Dear Daniel,<br>
    <br>
    I would recommend to compute the UHF NOs also. These are our main
    data and we will need to publish them. They are also the reference
    points for the UCCSD contributions. I think it is important to have
    everything double-checked since these calculations are not routine.<br>

                            <br>
                            I am back in Lubbock and followed Anita&#39;s
                            and your comments. I think the agreement in
                            the H.F. calculations is resolved. I expect
                            that the NO occupations according to Pulay
                            will also agree. The next question is how
                            does the new UHF wavefunction affect the
                            CCSD results. I imagine that one should
                            compute a total density matrix from the CCSD
                            wavefunction as well. Don&#39;t you think?<br>
                            What kind of NO occupations and NOs did you
                            use first? These were in the set of alpha
                            and beta spin orbitals. The space parts are
                            not orthogonal to each other. Thus, they are
                            difficult to interpret. The advantage of
                            diagonalizing the total spin density matrix
                            is that the resulting NOs refer to the same
                            basis. This question is more involved than I
                            thought.<br>

                                                          should be
                                                          correct.
