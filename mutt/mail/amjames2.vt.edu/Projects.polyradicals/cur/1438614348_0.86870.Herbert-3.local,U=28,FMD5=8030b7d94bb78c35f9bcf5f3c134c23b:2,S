Dear Hans,

I'll study the Pulay paper and see if we can add this calculation to our
SCF code.  It certainly seems trivial, assuming the density is just the sum
of the alpha and beta components.  The S^(1/2) must be his orthogonalizer,
though we normally use S^(-1/2), but perhaps that doesn't matter.  Simple
diagonalization of the AO-basis density should be a very simple thing.

    Dear Daniel,<br>
    <br>
    I still need some time concerning the comparison of yours and our
    stability analysis.<br>
    Concerning the NOs of the UHF wavefunction I attach the UNO-CAS
    paper of Pulay (see especially Eq. 3). Both Turbomole and Gaussian
    give the UHF NOs, which we listed in Table 5. I have to admit that I
    still need to study the Pulay paper more. As I understand it now,
    Pulay is talking about the NOs of the total density matrix, where
    alpha and beta spin density matrices are added up (this is what I
    understand he does not tell it explicitly). This matrix is then
    diagonalized leading to NOs within the same orbital space (not alpha
    and beta separated). The NO occupations you sent refer to alpha or
    beta spin orbitals?<br>

              Thank you for your results. Your calculations based on the
              RHF and UHF give=C2=A0 very similar NO occupations. We should
              compare the results in more detail. In our Table 5 we give
              the NO occupations of the UHF density. They are close to
              single occupation (4: HONO 1.234, LUNO 0.766). This should
              be the starting occupations for your CCSD calculations.
              Could you please compare this with your UHF results? Also,
              we should compare the character of the instability, for
              which orbitals does it occur. We should also compare the
              total SCF energies (restricted and unrestricted).<br>
              Anita, could you please collect our results in more
              detail?<br>
              <br>
              Best regards, Hans<span><br>

                          Thank you very much for your e-mail. We are
                          looking forward to your results. The most
                          important question from my point of view is
                          whether the restricted or the unrestricted
                          approach is the appropriate one (see my
                          previous e-mail). I think we should
                          concentrate on that question first of all,
                          taking the heptazethrene (str. 4) as example.
                          According to your restricted calculations one
                          gets a closed shell state, but our
                          multireference calculations and also the UHF
                          density shows the opposite. What do you think?<br=

                                        Dear Daniel, dear Andrew,<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Thank you for your e-mail and
                                        the data.<br>
                                        Concerning geometry differences:
                                        these are very small and come
                                        from the fact that Anita used
                                        Gaussian and Turbomole to verify
                                        the consistency of the results.
                                        She sent you the Gaussian
                                        optimized geometries but then
                                        followed up with Turbomole
                                        calculations. Finally, we
                                        decided to base all results on
                                        Turbomole and she changed the
                                        coordinates in the Supp. Mat. I
                                        am attaching her comments. You
                                        can see there that differences
                                        are negligible and you need not
                                        redo the calculations.<br>
                                        Concerning the question of the
                                        symmetry in the UDFT geometry
                                        optimizations for structures
                                        4-8. These were performed for
                                        the singlet ground states. The
                                        closed shell high-symmetry DFT
                                        solution is unstable. The spin
                                        unrestricted (U)DFT wavefunction
                                        is symmetry broken and has only
                                        Cs symmetry. You can see the
                                        orbitals=C2=A0 in Figs. 9S-13S of t=
he
                                        Supp. Mat. The C2h in Fig. 10S
                                        should also read as Cs. Thus,
                                        the MOs have Cs symmetry, but
                                        alpha and beta orbitals are
                                        equivalent so that the
                                        structural symmetry is higher,
                                        C2h and D2h, respectively. Thus,
                                        the formulations should be
                                        correct. However, we will
                                        explain this in the text. See
                                        also Anita&#39;s comments attached.=
