Sorry, I'm conflating two on-going projects.  These are NOT DFT
calculations, of course, but Hartree-Fock, which makes me wonder why we
don't get better agreement between our total energies.  Do your Turbomole
UHF calculations make use of density fitting integrals?  That would
potentially account for such a significant difference.

Nevertheless, I think the qualitative results are the same, and I'll
continue with my efforts to follow the Bu-irrep eigenvector.

My apologies for the confusing remarks about B3LYP in my last message!

    Dear Daniel,<br>
    <br>
    I am attaching the analysis of zethrene which Anita sent me.
    Currently, I am in Vienna and have only e-mail contact. I added some
    comments to her text. It is written with Track Changes, mainly for
    her information.<br>
    It seems to me that polarizing the Ag orbitals we get practically
    the same results as you, as much as I could see form the orbital
    energies. However, it would be good to know also your total energies
    and to compare the shape of the HOMO and LUMO.<br>
    <br>
    From the first stability analysis one would say that also the
    orbitals should be polarized in bu symmetry. It is surprising that
    this instability vanishes after modifying the ag orbitals. <br>
    In order to take into account the bu instability we performed a
    calculation in Cs symmetry and got a significant stabilization with
    respect to the ag step. Please see the attached file for details.
    Please note that the symmetry labels C2h and Cs refers only to the
    MOs! The geometry had been fixed for all calculations reported here
    at C2h symmetry.<br>
    With the broken Cs MOs we have also made geometry optimization
    getting an additional stabilization, but this is not considered
    here.<br>
    <br>
    Could you do similar calculations for comparison?<br>
    Best regards, Hans<span><br>

              <br>
              Thank you for your results. Your calculations based on the
              RHF and UHF give=C2=A0 very similar NO occupations. We should
              compare the results in more detail. In our Table 5 we give
              the NO occupations of the UHF density. They are close to
              single occupation (4: HONO 1.234, LUNO 0.766). This should
              be the starting occupations for your CCSD calculations.
              Could you please compare this with your UHF results? Also,
              we should compare the character of the instability, for
              which orbitals does it occur. We should also compare the
              total SCF energies (restricted and unrestricted).<br>
              Anita, could you please collect our results in more
              detail?<br>

                          Thank you very much for your e-mail. We are
                          looking forward to your results. The most
                          important question from my point of view is
                          whether the restricted or the unrestricted
                          approach is the appropriate one (see my
                          previous e-mail). I think we should
                          concentrate on that question first of all,
                          taking the heptazethrene (str. 4) as example.
                          According to your restricted calculations one
                          gets a closed shell state, but our
                          multireference calculations and also the UHF
                          density shows the opposite. What do you think?<br=

                                        <br>
                                        Thank you for your e-mail and
                                        the data.<br>
                                        Concerning geometry differences:
                                        these are very small and come
                                        from the fact that Anita used
                                        Gaussian and Turbomole to verify
                                        the consistency of the results.
                                        She sent you the Gaussian
                                        optimized geometries but then
                                        followed up with Turbomole
                                        calculations. Finally, we
                                        decided to base all results on
                                        Turbomole and she changed the
                                        coordinates in the Supp. Mat. I
                                        am attaching her comments. You
                                        can see there that differences
                                        are negligible and you need not
                                        redo the calculations.<br>
                                        Concerning the question of the
                                        symmetry in the UDFT geometry
                                        optimizations for structures
                                        4-8. These were performed for
                                        the singlet ground states. The
                                        closed shell high-symmetry DFT
                                        solution is unstable. The spin
                                        unrestricted (U)DFT wavefunction
                                        is symmetry broken and has only
                                        Cs symmetry. You can see the
                                        orbitals=C2=A0 in Figs. 9S-13S of t=
he
                                        Supp. Mat. The C2h in Fig. 10S
                                        should also read as Cs. Thus,
                                        the MOs have Cs symmetry, but
                                        alpha and beta orbitals are
                                        equivalent so that the
                                        structural symmetry is higher,
                                        C2h and D2h, respectively. Thus,
                                        the formulations should be
                                        correct. However, we will
                                        explain this in the text. See
                                        also Anita&#39;s comments attached.=

                                        orbitals (Figure 2) and the
                                        higher symmetry of the geometry.<br=
