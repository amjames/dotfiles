Dear Hans and Anita,

We've debugged some problems with frozen virtual spaces in our CC codes,
and we can now compute the natural orbital occupations.  AJ is putting some
last touches on the code, and we should then be able to get you the data
quickly.

In the meantime, I have a question about the choice of active spaces for
these systems.  From the material that Anita provided, it's clear that
you've decided not to include the entire =CF=80-MO space in these systems. =
 For
example, for phenalenyl, the full =CF=80 space would be 13 orbitals.  Howev=
er,
your CASSCF calculations limited the space only to seven MOs.  From looking
at the ROHF or UHF orbital energies for that system, I can see why this
would be a good idea, as those seven MOs have rather isolated energies
(more than 0.1 Eh away from their nearest energetic neighbors).
Furthermore, I note that including the full 13 =CF=80 MOs results excludes =
an
occupied MO that is quite close in energy to one of the "=CF=80" MOs chosen=
.  I
don't know what this MO is (I haven't plotted them), but that split
wouldn't make sense.

My question in the end is simple: is there a reason to limit the active
space to seven MOs apart from the energy separation issue and the
computational expense?

Best regards,

-Daniel
