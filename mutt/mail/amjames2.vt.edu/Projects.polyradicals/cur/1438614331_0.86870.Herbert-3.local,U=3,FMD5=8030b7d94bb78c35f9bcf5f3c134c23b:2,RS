Dear Hans,

Thanks for the update.  We were able to work out the issues with the code
here, and AJ has been running the CC computations.  Now that the semester
has finally ended, we should be able to get data to you soon.  And if you
go ahead and send the new geometries, we can work with those as well.

-Daniel
