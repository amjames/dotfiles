Dear Hans,

I want to apologize for the delay in our response.  AJ and I have been
dealing with a pair of summer schools =E2=80=93 one focused on computationa=
l
chemistry software development, the other on molecular response properties
=E2=80=93 that started this past week and will continue through next week. =
 I'm the
host and an instructor in both schools, and AJ has been invaluable as the
primary organizer.  Unfortunately, the schools have pulled us both away
from dealing with the polyradical project.  AJ has continued his
computations, but we haven't been able to get together to go through his
results and provide you with a proper response.  I promise that we will get
back to you and Anita as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience!

Best regards,

-Daniel

    Dear Daniel, dear Andrew,<br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your e-mail and the data.<br>
    Concerning geometry differences: these are very small and come from
    the fact that Anita used Gaussian and Turbomole to verify the
    consistency of the results. She sent you the Gaussian optimized
    geometries but then followed up with Turbomole calculations.
    Finally, we decided to base all results on Turbomole and she changed
    the coordinates in the Supp. Mat. I am attaching her comments. You
    can see there that differences are negligible and you need not redo
    the calculations.<br>
    Concerning the question of the symmetry in the UDFT geometry
    optimizations for structures 4-8. These were performed for the
    singlet ground states. The closed shell high-symmetry DFT solution
    is unstable. The spin unrestricted (U)DFT wavefunction is symmetry
    broken and has only Cs symmetry. You can see the orbitals=C2=A0 in Figs=
.
    9S-13S of the Supp. Mat. The C2h in Fig. 10S should also read as Cs.
    Thus, the MOs have Cs symmetry, but alpha and beta orbitals are
    equivalent so that the structural symmetry is higher, C2h and D2h,
    respectively. Thus, the formulations should be correct. However, we
    will explain this in the text. See also Anita&#39;s comments attached.<=
br>
    I am also attaching a paper on oligoacenes where you see the same
    effect, the symmetry broken orbitals (Figure 2) and the higher
    symmetry of the geometry.<br>
    <br>
    Do you agree?<br>
    <br>
    Please see my follow-up e-mail on the symmetry breaking.<br>
